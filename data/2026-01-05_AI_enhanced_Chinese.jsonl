An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff082D\u548c10D\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f02\u5e38\u7387\uff080.05%-20%\uff09\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\uff081,000-10,000\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f3014\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff1a\u5c11\u4e8e20\u4e2a\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08kNN/LOF\uff09\u5360\u4f18\uff1b30-50\u4e2a\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u534a\u76d1\u7763\uff08XGBOD\uff09\u548c\u76d1\u7763\uff08SVM/CatBoost\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single \"breaker token\" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings.

We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness). GPT-4.1 achieved the highest quantitative performance, with 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring prediction, outperforming Gemma-3-4B-it and Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Qualitatively, GPT-4.1 also produced the most culturally appropriate, clear, and contextually relevant responses. AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities.

An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5b88\u6052\u4e00\u81f4\u7f16\u7801\uff08CCE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e3a\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u76c6\u5730\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6444\u5165\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u5e95\u7269\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u6001\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm. We have illustrated the performance of the proposed approach in a real-world problem in an urban last-mile package delivery workforce operating at Azuqueca de Henares, Spain.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a multi-algorithm approach to balance workload among delivery workers by optimizing distance and effort, tested successfully in a real-world urban delivery system.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the inefficiency and imbalance in workload distribution among delivery workers caused by traditional geographical proximity-based assignment methods.", "method": "The method involves a multi-algorithm approach, including versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm.

We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions.

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Game mechanics define the rules and interactions that govern gameplay, and designing them manually is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. Mortar combines a quality-diversity algorithm with a large language model to explore a diverse set of mechanics, which are evaluated by synthesising complete games that incorporate both evolved mechanics and those drawn from an archive. The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u809d\u786c\u5316\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bca\u65ad\u524d1\u5e74\u30012\u5e74\u548c3\u5e74\u7684\u809d\u786c\u5316\u53d1\u75c5\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u578b\u5b66\u672f\u536b\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u56de\u987e\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u901a\u8fc7ICD-9/10\u4ee3\u7801\u8bc6\u522b\u8102\u80aa\u809d\u60a3\u8005\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a\u809d\u786c\u5316\u7ec4\u548c\u975e\u809d\u786c\u5316\u7ec4\u3002\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a97\u53e3\u6c47\u603b\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u548c\u5171\u75c5\u6307\u6570\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e1\u5e74\u30012\u5e74\u548c3\u5e74\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\uff08AUC\uff09\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eFIB-4\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u961f\u5217\u5305\u62ec1\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u76843,043\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u30012\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u76841,981\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u548c3\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u76841,470\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8eFIB-4\u3002XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u57281\u5e74\u30012\u5e74\u548c3\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.81\u30010.73\u548c0.69\uff0c\u800cFIB-4\u7684AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.71\u30010.63\u548c0.57\u3002\u968f\u7740\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5ef6\u957f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684FIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u809d\u786c\u5316\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u809d\u786c\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u9632\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.\n  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational.

We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level.

Concretely, we show that an Euler Net trained to achieve 100.00% in classic syllogistic reasoning can be trained to reach 100.00% accuracy in disjunctive syllogistic reasoning.

When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings.

To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes.

Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level.

In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes.

This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages.

Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget.

Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\\text{MW}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity.

Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives.
