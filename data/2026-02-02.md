### [1] [Attention Isn't All You Need for Emotion Recognition:Domain Features Outperform Transformers on the EAV Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22161)
*Anmol Guragain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Complex attention mechanisms underperform on small emotion recognition datasets; simple domain-specific modifications yield better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets for multimodal emotion recognition.

Method: Implemented three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3).

Result: Sophisticated attention mechanisms underperformed on small datasets, while simple domain-appropriate modifications (e.g., delta MFCCs for audio, frequency-domain features for EEG) proved effective. Vision transformer baseline (M1) outperformed the paper's ViViT result.

Conclusion: For small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9\% to \textbf{65.56\%} (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved \textbf{67.62\%} (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached \textbf{75.30\%}, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5\%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved \textbf{72.68\%} (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing attention as a potential solution to address the challenges of computation requirements in the future. Earth observation (EO) has entered the era of Big Data, and the computational demands for effectively analyzing large EO data with complex deep learning models have become a bottleneck. Motivated by this, we aim to leverage quantum computing for EO data classification and explore its advantages despite the current limitations of quantum devices. This paper presents a hybrid model that incorporates multitask learning to assist efficient data encoding and employs a location weight module with quantum convolution operations to extract valid features for classification. The validity of our proposed model was evaluated using multiple EO benchmarks. Additionally, we experimentally explored the generalizability of our model and investigated the factors contributing to its advantage, highlighting the potential of QML in EO data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成临床报告总结长期EEG记录中的异常模式、诊断发现和临床解释是劳动密集型的任务。

Method: 开发了CELM模型，结合预训练的EEG基础模型和语言模型，实现多模态学习。

Result: 在患者历史监督下，生成指标（如ROUGE-1和METEOR）相对提升了70%--95%；零样本设置下，生成分数为0.43--0.52，优于基线。

Conclusion: CELM能够高效生成多尺度临床报告，性能显著提升，并公开了模型和基准构建流程。

Abstract: Generating clinical reports that summarize abnormal patterns, diagnostic findings, and clinical interpretations from long-term EEG recordings remains labor-intensive. We curate a large-scale clinical EEG dataset with $9{,}922$ reports paired with approximately $11{,}000$ hours of EEG recordings from $9{,}048$ patients. We therefore develop CELM, the first clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model capable of summarizing long-duration, variable-length EEG recordings and performing end-to-end clinical report generation at multiple scales, including recording description, background activity, epileptiform abnormalities, events/seizures, and impressions. Experimental results show that, with patient history supervision, our method achieves $70\%$--$95\%$ average relative improvements in standard generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1 and METEOR) from $0.2$--$0.3$ to $0.4$--$0.6$. In the zero-shot setting without patient history, CELM attains generation scores in the range of $0.43$--$0.52$, compared to baselines of $0.17$--$0.26$. CELM integrates pretrained EEG foundation models with language models to enable scalable multimodal learning. We release our model and benchmark construction pipeline at [URL].

### [4] [FedAdaVR: Adaptive Variance Reduction for Robust Federated Learning under Limited Client Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22204)
*S M Ruhul Kabir Howlader,Xiao Chen,Yifei Xie,Lu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAdaVR通过自适应优化器和方差缩减技术解决联邦学习的异构性问题，FedAdaVR-Quant进一步降低内存需求，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中因客户端部分参与导致的异构性问题，尤其是梯度噪声、客户端漂移和部分参与错误。

Method: 提出FedAdaVR算法，结合自适应优化器和方差缩减技术，利用最近存储的客户端更新模拟其参与；FedAdaVR-Quant进一步通过量化存储降低内存需求。

Result: FedAdaVR在非凸条件下收敛，能消除部分参与错误；实验表明其在IID和非IID设置下均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedAdaVR和FedAdaVR-Quant通过自适应优化器和方差缩减技术有效解决了联邦学习中因客户端部分参与导致的异构性问题，显著提升了模型性能并降低了内存需求。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) encounters substantial challenges due to heterogeneity, leading to gradient noise, client drift, and partial client participation errors, the last of which is the most pervasive but remains insufficiently addressed in current literature. In this paper, we propose FedAdaVR, a novel FL algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneity issues caused by sporadic client participation by incorporating an adaptive optimiser with a variance reduction technique. This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, demonstrate that FedAdaVR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.

### [5] [Causal Imitation Learning Under Measurement Error and Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22206)
*Shi Bo,AmirEmad Ghassami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces \texttt{CausIL}, a framework for offline imitation learning under measurement error, using causal modeling to improve robustness to distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of standard behavioral cloning in handling spurious state-action correlations and distribution shifts caused by noisy measurements.

Method: The method involves modeling causal relationships among variables, treating noisy state observations as proxies, and using adversarial procedures for continuous state spaces.

Result: The results show that \texttt{CausIL} improves robustness to distribution shift compared to baseline behavioral cloning methods, as demonstrated on semi-simulated longitudinal data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed framework, \texttt{CausIL}, effectively addresses the challenges of offline imitation learning under measurement error and distribution shift, outperforming standard behavioral cloning methods in robustness.

Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) when part of the decision-relevant state is observed only through noisy measurements and the distribution may change between training and deployment. Such settings induce spurious state-action correlations, so standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- whether conditioning on raw measurements or ignoring them -- can converge to systematically biased policies under distribution shift. We propose a general framework for IL under measurement error, inspired by explicitly modeling the causal relationships among the variables, yielding a target that retains a causal interpretation and is robust to distribution shift. Building on ideas from proximal causal inference, we introduce \texttt{CausIL}, which treats noisy state observations as proxy variables, and we provide identification conditions under which the target policy is recoverable from demonstrations without rewards or interactive expert queries. We develop estimators for both discrete and continuous state spaces; for continuous settings, we use an adversarial procedure over RKHS function classes to learn the required parameters. We evaluate \texttt{CausIL} on semi-simulated longitudinal data from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 cohort and demonstrate improved robustness to distribution shift compared to BC baselines.

### [6] [DAJ: Data-Reweighted LLM Judge for Test-Time Scaling in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22230)
*Peijia Qin,Ruiyi Zhang,Qi Cao,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAJ是一种基于推理的LLM评判器，通过双层数据加权学习框架解决分布偏移问题，在代码生成测试时间扩展中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM评判器训练中因分布偏移（如问题难度不平衡、训练任务与评估基准不匹配、训练数据与推理模型行为不一致）导致的可靠性问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于推理的LLM评判器DAJ，采用双层数据加权学习框架，通过可验证奖励进行训练。

Result: DAJ在实验中表现优异，能够自动关注困难问题、同分布样本和轨迹对齐数据。

Conclusion: DAJ在LiveCodeBench和BigCodeBench上实现了最先进的性能，优于其他测试时间扩展方法和领先的专有模型。

Abstract: Test-time scaling for code generation commonly relies on Best-of-N selection, in which multiple candidate solutions are sampled from a base model, and the best one is selected by an LLM judge. However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics. Empirically, DAJ achieves state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench, outperforming strong test-time scaling baselines as well as leading proprietary models.

### [7] [FunPRM: Function-as-Step Process Reward Model with Meta Reward Correction for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22249)
*Ruiyi Zhang,Peijia Qin,Qi Cao,Eric Xue,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FunPRM通过模块化代码生成和元学习奖励校正机制，显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂编程任务中的表现，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于过程奖励模型（PRM）的方法在代码生成中效果不佳，主要原因是代码缺乏有意义的步骤分解和部分解正确性评分的噪声。

Method: FunPRM通过鼓励模块化代码生成，将函数视为PRM推理步骤，并引入元学习奖励校正机制，利用单元测试评估系统净化噪声部分解奖励。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench和BigCodeBench上的实验表明，FunPRM在五种基础LLM中表现优于现有方法，尤其在结合O4-mini时达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: FunPRM不仅提升了代码生成的性能，还生成了更易读和可重用的代码，为开发者提供了实际价值。

Abstract: Code generation is a core application of large language models (LLMs), yet LLMs still frequently fail on complex programming tasks. Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini. Furthermore, FunPRM produces code that is more readable and reusable for developers.

### [8] [Symmetry Breaking in Transformers for Efficient and Interpretable Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22257)
*Eva Silverstein,Daniel Kunin,Vasudev Shyam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过引入对称性破坏协议来改进注意力机制的方法，提升了简单优化器的性能并增强了模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制中存在冗余的旋转自由度，这些自由度不影响模型输出但可能影响优化过程。

Method: 通过批量采样的、非学习的查询和值偏置，在旋转空间中引入一个首选方向。

Result: 该方法显著提升了简单优化器的性能，并在某些情况下缩小了与复杂优化器的差距，同时增强了注意力头的语义解释性。

Conclusion: 通过最小且原则性的架构改进，可以同时提升模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in its standard implementation contains extraneous rotational degrees of freedom that are carried through computation but do not affect model activations or outputs. We introduce a simple symmetry-breaking protocol that inserts a preferred direction into this rotational space through batchwise-sampled, unlearned query and value biases. This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads. Overall, our results show that minimal, principled architectural changes can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability.

### [9] [Tabular Foundation Models Can Do Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22259)
*Da In Kim,Wei Siang Lai,Kelly W. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分类的框架，将静态和动态生存分析转化为一系列二分类问题，通过离散化事件时间处理右删失数据，并证明其能恢复真实生存概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于右删失的存在，现有的表格基础模型难以直接用于生存分析，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过离散化事件时间，将生存分析问题转化为一系列二分类问题，并利用现有的表格基础模型进行上下文学习。

Result: 在53个真实数据集上的评估表明，该方法在多个生存指标上优于经典和深度学习基线。

Conclusion: 该分类框架为表格基础模型在生存分析中的应用提供了一种有效且无需显式训练的方法。

Abstract: While tabular foundation models have achieved remarkable success in classification and regression, adapting them to model time-to-event outcomes for survival analysis is non-trivial due to right-censoring, where data observations may end before the event occurs. We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.

*Ramakant Kumar,Pravin Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A low-cost HAR framework using STM outperforms traditional classifiers, achieving high accuracy for remote healthcare and wellness applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited access to medical infrastructure leads to neglect and poor adherence to therapeutic exercises for elderly and vulnerable patients. The study aims to address this gap by providing an automated, low-cost solution for activity recognition.

Method: The study employs a low-cost, automated HAR framework using wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Data on various activities were collected via accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN) were compared with the proposed STM.

Result: SVM achieved 93.33% accuracy, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11%. STM outperformed these models with 96.67% test accuracy and 98.50% cross-validation accuracy, leveraging tensor representations for robust classification.

Conclusion: The proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM) significantly outperforms traditional classifiers in human activity recognition, achieving higher accuracy and robustness. This framework offers a scalable solution for remote healthcare and wellness applications, particularly in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Limited access to medical infrastructure forces elderly and vulnerable patients to rely on home-based care, often leading to neglect and poor adherence to therapeutic exercises such as yoga or physiotherapy. To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, child activity monitoring, yoga feedback, and smart home wellness, offering a scalable solution for low-resource and rural healthcare settings.

### [11] [Task-Uniform Convergence and Backward Transfer in Federated Domain-Incremental Learning with Partial Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22274)
*Longtao Xu,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECIAL是一种无内存的FDIL算法，通过服务器端锚点控制累积漂移，理论证明其能保护早期任务并高效学习，实验验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的联邦系统通常处理动态数据，输入分布会漂移，而隐私规则禁止原始数据共享。FDIL（联邦域增量学习）在这种环境下研究，但缺乏理论支持，特别是关于后向知识转移（BKT）保证和跨任务收敛速率的问题。

Method: SPECIAL是一种简单、无内存的FDIL算法，通过在普通FedAvg中添加一个服务器端锚点，每个轮次中服务器通过轻量级的近端项将均匀采样的参与客户端更新推向先前的全局模型。

Result: SPECIAL算法在理论分析中展示了其能够保护早期任务的知识（通过BKT边界），并在所有任务中高效学习（通过通信效率高的非凸收敛速率）。实验结果进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SPECIAL算法通过引入轻量级的服务器端锚点，有效控制了累积漂移，同时保持了通信和模型大小不变。理论分析表明，SPECIAL不仅能够保护早期任务的知识，还能在所有任务中高效学习，实验进一步验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Real-world federated systems seldom operate on static data: input distributions drift while privacy rules forbid raw-data sharing. We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of SPECIAL.

*Mingyu Lu,Soham Gadgil,Chris Lin,Chanwoo Kim,Su-In Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurrogateSHAP is a retraining-free framework for efficient Shapley value attribution in T2I models, improving fairness and scalability in data marketplaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottlenecks of the Shapley value approach in T2I diffusion models, ensuring fair compensation and sustainable data marketplaces.

Method: The paper proposes SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates Shapley values by inferring from a pretrained model and using a gradient-boosted tree to derive values analytically.

Result: SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods across diverse attribution tasks (image quality, aesthetics, product diversity) and effectively identifies influential contributors while reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: SurrogateSHAP provides a scalable and efficient method for attributing contributions in T2I diffusion models, outperforming prior approaches while reducing computational costs. It also aids in identifying spurious correlations in safety-critical models.

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are increasingly used in real-world creative workflows, a principled framework for valuing contributors who provide a collection of data is essential for fair compensation and sustainable data marketplaces. While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that SurrogateSHAP effectively localizes data sources responsible for spurious correlations in clinical images, providing a scalable path toward auditing safety-critical generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过控制理论视角，系统化地设计优化器，避免对现有优化器的启发式改进，并提供一种统一的几何框架。

Method: RLOs 基于控制理论框架，将优化问题重新解释为黎曼参数流形上的离散时间控制系统，并通过识别 Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM) 来组织训练动态。

Result: RLOs 不仅能够恢复经典算法，还能通过严格的 Lyapunov 函数证明收敛性，并在大规模基准测试中表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs) 通过将控制理论与现代机器学习优化相结合，提供了一个统一的框架和系统工具包，用于设计稳定且高效的优化器。

Abstract: We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks. Overall, RLOs bridge control theory and modern machine learning optimization, providing a unified language and a systematic toolkit for designing stable, effective optimizers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Model merging combines knowledge from separately fine-tuned models, yet success factors remain poorly understood. While recent work treats mergeability as an intrinsic property, we show with an architecture-agnostic framework that it fundamentally depends on both the merging method and the partner tasks. Using linear optimization over a set of interpretable pairwise metrics (e.g., gradient L2 distance), we uncover properties correlating with post-merge performance across four merging methods. We find substantial variation in success drivers (46.7% metric overlap; 55.3% sign agreement), revealing method-specific "fingerprints". Crucially, however, subspace overlap and gradient alignment metrics consistently emerge as foundational, method-agnostic prerequisites for compatibility. These findings provide a diagnostic foundation for understanding mergeability and motivate future fine-tuning strategies that explicitly encourage these properties.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) has established itself as an efficient paradigm for temporal processing. However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers a promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape.

Abstract: Conditional generative models map input variables to complex, high-dimensional distributions, enabling realistic sample generation in a diverse set of domains. A critical challenge with these models is the absence of calibrated uncertainty, which undermines trust in individual outputs for high-stakes applications. To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, yet both centralized and decentralized approaches face challenges in scalability, security, and update validation. We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks. This makes ZK-HybridFL a scalable and secure solution for decentralized FL across diverse environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automatic workflow generation is the process of automatically synthesizing sequences of LLM calls, tool invocations, and post-processing steps for complex end-to-end tasks. Most prior methods cast this task as an optimization problem with limited theoretical grounding. We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior. We instantiate BWG as \textbf{BayesFlow}, a training-free algorithm for workflow construction. Across six benchmark datasets, BayesFlow improves accuracy by up to 9 percentage points over SOTA workflow generation baselines and by up to 65 percentage points over zero-shot prompting, establishing BWG as a principled upgrade to search-based workflow design. Code will be available on https://github.com/BoYuanVisionary/BayesFlow.

Abstract: We study the problem of propagating the mean and covariance of a general multivariate Gaussian distribution through a deep (residual) neural network using layer-by-layer moment matching. We close a longstanding gap by deriving exact moment matching for the probit, GeLU, ReLU (as a limit of GeLU), Heaviside (as a limit of probit), and sine activation functions; for both feedforward and generalized residual layers. On random networks, we find orders-of-magnitude improvements in the KL divergence error metric, up to a millionfold, over popular alternatives. On real data, we find competitive statistical calibration for inference under epistemic uncertainty in the input. On a variational Bayes network, we show that our method attains hundredfold improvements in KL divergence from Monte Carlo ground truth over a state-of-the-art deterministic inference method. We also give an a priori error bound and a preliminary analysis of stochastic feedforward neurons, which have recently attracted general interest.

Abstract: Regression models are widely used in industrial processes, engineering and in natural and physical sciences, yet their robustness to poisoning has received less attention. When it has, studies often assume unrealistic threat models and are thus less useful in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal stealthy attack formulation that considers different degrees of detectability and show that it bypasses state-of-the-art defenses. We further propose a new methodology based on normalization of objectives to evaluate different trade-offs between effectiveness and detectability. Finally, we develop a novel defense (BayesClean) against stealthy attacks. BayesClean improves on previous defenses when attacks are stealthy and the number of poisoning points is significant.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone. Supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/SCALAR.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely static and are frequently updated in practice. A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed "aligned" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.

Abstract: Many real-world optimization problems involve an expensive ground-truth oracle (e.g., human evaluation, physical experiments) and a cheap, low-fidelity prediction oracle (e.g., machine learning models, simulations). Meanwhile, abundant offline data (e.g., past experiments and predictions) are often available and can be used to pretrain powerful predictive models, as well as to provide an informative prior. We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty. We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models. These results establish PA-GP-UCB as a general and sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback.

Abstract: Recovering missing flows on the edges of a network, while exactly respecting local conservation laws, is a fundamental inverse problem that arises in many systems such as transportation, energy, and mobility. We introduce FlowSymm, a novel architecture that combines (i) a group-action on divergence-free flows, (ii) a graph-attention encoder to learn feature-conditioned weights over these symmetry-preserving actions, and (iii) a lightweight Tikhonov refinement solved via implicit bilevel optimization. The method first anchors the given observation on a minimum-norm divergence-free completion. We then compute an orthonormal basis for all admissible group actions that leave the observed flows invariant and parameterize the valid solution subspace, which shows an Abelian group structure under vector addition. A stack of GATv2 layers then encodes the graph and its edge features into per-edge embeddings, which are pooled over the missing edges and produce per-basis attention weights. This attention-guided process selects a set of physics-aware group actions that preserve the observed flows. Finally, a scalar Tikhonov penalty refines the missing entries via a convex least-squares solver, with gradients propagated implicitly through Cholesky factorization. Across three real-world flow benchmarks (traffic, power, bike), FlowSymm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE and correlation metrics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly accessed as remotely hosted services by edge and enterprise clients that cannot run frontier models locally. Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.

Abstract: We study continual mean estimation, where data vectors arrive sequentially and the goal is to maintain accurate estimates of the running mean. We address this problem under user-level differential privacy, which protects each user's entire dataset even when they contribute multiple data points. Previous work on this problem has focused on pure differential privacy. While important, this approach limits applicability, as it leads to overly noisy estimates. In contrast, we analyze the problem under approximate differential privacy, adopting recent advances in the Matrix Factorization mechanism. We introduce a novel mean estimation specific factorization, which is both efficient and accurate, achieving asymptotically lower mean-squared error bounds in continual mean estimation under user-level differential privacy.

Abstract: Indoor localization is a critical enabler for a wide range of location-based services in smart environments, including navigation, asset tracking, and safety-critical applications. Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.

Abstract: Model routing chooses which language model to use for each query. By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool. It flexibly adapts to user needs: it can boost accuracy by up to 25.7% when performance is the priority, or cut costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency matters most.

Abstract: Modern clinical practice relies on evidence-based guidelines implemented as compact scoring systems composed of a small number of interpretable decision rules. While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores.

Abstract: Monitoring the performance of classification models in production is critical yet challenging due to strict labeling budgets, one-shot batch acquisition of labels and extremely low error rates. We propose a general framework based on Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) that directly addresses these constraints in model monitoring. While SIS has previously been applied in specialized domains, our theoretical analysis establishes its broad applicability to the monitoring of classification models. Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains. Experiments across binary and multiclass tasks demonstrate consistent efficiency improvements under fixed label budgets, underscoring SIS as a principled, label-efficient, and operationally lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring.

Abstract: Molecular representations fundamentally shape how machine learning systems reason about molecular structure and physical properties. Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields. We evaluate MolField on molecular dynamics and property prediction. Our results show that treating molecules as continuous functions fundamentally changes how molecular representations generalize across tasks and yields downstream behavior that is stable to how molecules are discretized or queried.

Abstract: Recovering governing equations from data is central to scientific discovery, yet existing methods often break down under noisy, partial observations, or rely on black-box latent dynamics that obscure mechanism. We introduce MAAT (Model Aware Approximation of Trajectories), a framework for symbolic discovery built on knowledge-informed Kernel State Reconstruction. MAAT formulates state reconstruction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and directly incorporates structural and semantic priors such as non-negativity, conservation laws, and domain-specific observation models into the reconstruction objective, while accommodating heterogeneous sampling and measurement granularity. This yields smooth, physically consistent state estimates with analytic time derivatives, providing a principled interface between fragmented sensor data and symbolic regression. Across twelve diverse scientific benchmarks and multiple noise regimes, MAAT substantially reduces state-estimation MSE for trajectories and derivatives used by downstream symbolic regression relative to strong baselines.

Abstract: Cell Painting is a microscopy-based, high-content imaging assay that produces rich morphological profiles of cells and can support drug discovery by quantifying cellular responses to chemical perturbations. At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality.

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the gold standard for training machine learning models with formal differential privacy guarantees. Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD. We show that the computational overhead is minimal and empirically demonstrate improved accuracy over DP-SGD.

Abstract: The knowledge gradient is a popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimization (BO) for optimizing black-box objectives with noisy function evaluations. Many practical settings, however, allow only pairwise comparison queries, yielding a preferential BO problem where direct function evaluations are unavailable. Extending the knowledge gradient to preferential BO is hindered by its computational challenge. At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable. In this paper, we address this challenge by deriving an exact and analytical knowledge gradient for preferential BO. We show that the exact knowledge gradient performs strongly on a suite of benchmark problems, often outperforming existing acquisition functions. In addition, we also present a case study illustrating the limitation of the knowledge gradient in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Modern supply chains must balance high-speed logistics with environmental impact and security constraints, prompting a surge of interest in AI-enabled Internet of Things (AIoT) solutions for global commerce. However, conventional supply chain optimization models often overlook crucial sustainability goals and cyber vulnerabilities, leaving systems susceptible to both ecological harm and malicious attacks. To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands. These findings reinforce the potential for quantum-inspired AIoT frameworks to drive secure, eco-conscious supply chain operations at scale, laying the groundwork for globally connected infrastructures that responsibly meet both consumer and environmental needs.

Abstract: We evaluate language models on their ability to explore interactive environments under a limited interaction budget. We introduce three parametric tasks with controllable exploration difficulty, spanning continuous and discrete environments. Across state-of-the-art models, we find systematic under-exploration and suboptimal solutions, with performance often significantly worse than simple explore--exploit heuristic baselines and scaling weakly as the budget increases. Finally, we study two lightweight interventions: splitting a fixed budget into parallel executions, which surprisingly improves performance despite a no-gain theoretical result for our tasks, and periodically summarizing the interaction history, which preserves key discoveries and further improves exploration.

Abstract: Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have adopted block rotations to diffuse outliers prior to rounding. While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.

Abstract: Given a Markov decision process (MDP), we seek to learn representations for a range of policies to facilitate behavior steering at test time. As policies of an MDP are uniquely determined by their occupancy measures, we propose modeling policy representations as expectations of state-action feature maps with respect to occupancy measures. We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training.

Abstract: Language model agents often appear capable of self-recovery after failing tool call executions, yet this behavior lacks a formal explanation. We present a predictive theory that resolves this gap by showing that recoverability follows a measurable law. To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents.

Abstract: We study the problem of quantifying how far an empirical distribution deviates from Gaussianity under the framework of optimal transport. By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \emph{not} be the \(W_2\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores.

Abstract: Safe learning is essential for deploying learningbased controllers in safety-critical robotic systems, yet existing approaches often enforce multiple safety constraints uniformly or via fixed priority orders, leading to infeasibility and brittle behavior. In practice, safety requirements are heterogeneous and admit only partial priority relations, where some constraints are comparable while others are inherently incomparable. We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction. Experiments on multi-obstacle navigation, constrained robot manipulation, and vision-based autonomous driving demonstrate improved feasibility, robustness, and scalability over unstructured and differentiable quadratic program-based safety layers.

Abstract: Being polite is free - or is it? In this paper, we quantify the energy cost of seemingly innocuous messages such as ``thank you'' when interacting with large language models, often used by users to convey politeness. Using real-world conversation traces and fine-grained energy measurements, we quantify how input length, output length and model size affect energy use. While politeness is our motivating example, it also serves as a controlled and reproducible proxy for measuring the energy footprint of a typical LLM interaction. Our findings provide actionable insights for building more sustainable and efficient LLM applications, especially in increasingly widespread real-world contexts like chat. As user adoption grows and billions of prompts are processed daily, understanding and mitigating this cost becomes crucial - not just for efficiency, but for sustainable AI deployment.

Abstract: Machine unlearning offers a practical alternative to avoid full model re-training by approximately removing the influence of specific user data. While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in production, contributing towards shifting the burden in terms of computational resources and energy demands from training to inference. While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack. Our findings motivate phase-aware energy profiling and system-level optimizations for greener AI services.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity (MF) regression often operates in regimes of extreme data imbalance, where the commonly-used Gaussian-process (GP) surrogates struggle with cubic scaling costs and overfit to sparse high-fidelity observations, limiting efficiency and generalization in real-world applications. We introduce FIRE, a training-free MF framework that couples tabular foundation models (TFMs) to perform zero-shot in-context Bayesian inference via a high-fidelity correction model conditioned on the low-fidelity model's posterior predictive distributions. This cross-fidelity information transfer via distributional summaries captures heteroscedastic errors, enabling robust residual learning without model retraining. Across 31 benchmark problems spanning synthetic and real-world tasks (e.g., DrivAerNet, LCBench), FIRE delivers a stronger performance-time trade-off than seven state-of-the-art GP-based or deep learning MF regression methods, ranking highest in accuracy and uncertainty quantification with runtime advantages. Limitations include context window constraints and dependence on the quality of the pre-trained TFM's.

Abstract: Many key challenges in biological design-such as small-molecule drug discovery, antimicrobial peptide development, and protein engineering-can be framed as black-box optimization over vast, complex structured spaces. Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints. In follow-up in vitro validation, PABLO-optimized peptides showed strong activity against drug-resistant pathogens, underscoring the practical potential of PABLO for therapeutic discovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graphs provide a natural representation of relational structure that arises across diverse domains. Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.

Abstract: Multi-stage ML inference pipelines are difficult to autoscale due to heterogeneous resources, cross-stage coupling, and dynamic bottleneck migration. We present SAIR, an autoscaling framework that uses an LLM as an in-context reinforcement learning controller, improving its policy online from reward-labeled interaction histories without gradient updates. SAIR combines Pareto-dominance reward shaping with a provable separation margin, surprisal-guided experience retrieval for context efficiency, and fine-grained GPU rate control via user-space CUDA interception. We provide regret analysis decomposing error into retrieval coverage and LLM selection components. On four ML serving pipelines under three workload patterns, SAIR achieves the best or tied-best P99 latency and effective resource cost among deployed baselines, improving P99 by up to 50% and reducing effective cost by up to 97% (under GPU rate-control assumptions), with 86% bottleneck detection accuracy and no offline training.

Abstract: Identifying the root causes of outliers is a fundamental problem in causal inference and anomaly detection. Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models. Extensive experiments on synthetic random graphs and real-world cloud service and supply chain datasets show that SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a structured alternative to standard MLPs, yet a principled theory for their training dynamics, generalization, and privacy properties remains limited. In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(ε,δ)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\sqrt{d}/(nε)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.

Abstract: Multimodal-attributed graphs (MMAGs) provide a unified framework for modeling complex relational data by integrating heterogeneous modalities with graph structures. While centralized learning has shown promising performance, MMAGs in real-world applications are often distributed across isolated platforms and cannot be shared due to privacy concerns or commercial constraints. Federated graph learning (FGL) offers a natural solution for collaborative training under such settings; however, existing studies largely focus on single-modality graphs and do not adequately address the challenges unique to multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL). To bridge this gap, we present MM-OpenFGL, the first comprehensive benchmark that systematically formalizes the MMFGL paradigm and enables rigorous evaluation. MM-OpenFGL comprises 19 multimodal datasets spanning 7 application domains, 8 simulation strategies capturing modality and topology variations, 6 downstream tasks, and 57 state-of-the-art methods implemented through a modular API. Extensive experiments investigate MMFGL from the perspectives of necessity, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, offering valuable insights for future research on MMFGL.

In recent years, efforts have been made to automate leaderboard generation, but existing datasets for this purpose are limited by capturing only the best results from each paper and limited metadata. We present MetaLead, a fully human-annotated ML Leaderboard dataset that captures all experimental results for result transparency and contains extra metadata, such as the result experimental type: baseline, proposed method, or variation of proposed method for experiment-type guided comparisons, and explicitly separates train and test dataset for cross-domain assessment. This enriched structure makes MetaLead a powerful resource for more transparent and nuanced evaluations across ML research.

Abstract: The rapid growth and continuous structural evolution of dynamic networks make effective predictions increasingly challenging. To enable prediction models to adapt to complex temporal environments, they need to be robust to emerging structural changes. We propose a dynamic network learning framework CoDCL, which combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to address this deficiency.Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive strategy to generate high-quality counterfactual data, combining a dynamic treatments design with efficient structural neighborhood exploration to quantify the temporal changes in interaction patterns.Crucially, the entire CoDCL is designed as a plug-and-play universal module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing temporal graph models without requiring architectural modifications.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that CoDCL significantly gains state-of-the-art baseline models in the field of dynamic networks, confirming the critical role of integrating counterfactual data augmentation into dynamic representation learning.

Abstract: GRPO is a standard approach to endowing pretrained LLMs with reasoning capabilities. It estimates the advantage of an outcome from a group of $K$ outcomes, and promotes those with positive advantages inside a trust region. Since GRPO discriminates between good and bad outcomes softly, it benefits from additional refinements such as asymmetric clipping and zero-variance data filtering. While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes. Our approach can be viewed as an online instantiation of (multi-label) noise contrastive estimation for LLM reasoning. We validate our method by demonstrating competitive performance on a suite of challenging math benchmarks against strong baselines such as DAPO and online DPO.

Abstract: Data and pipeline parallelism are key strategies for scaling neural network training across distributed devices, but their high communication cost necessitates co-located computing clusters with fast interconnects, limiting their scalability. We address this communication bottleneck by introducing asynchronous updates across both parallelism axes, relaxing the co-location requirement at the expense of introducing staleness between pipeline stages and data parallel replicas. To mitigate staleness, for pipeline parallelism, we adopt a weight look-ahead approach, and for data parallelism, we introduce an asynchronous sparse averaging method equipped with an exponential moving average based correction mechanism. We provide convergence guarantees for both sparse averaging and asynchronous updates. Experiments on large-scale language models (up to \em 1B parameters) demonstrate that our approach matches the performance of the fully synchronous baseline, while significantly reducing communication overhead.

Abstract: Can a diffusion model trained on bedrooms recover human faces? Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably.

Abstract: Forecasting future events is highly valuable in decision-making and is a robust measure of general intelligence. As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for decomposing language model representations into interpretable features. Current interpretation methods infer feature semantics from activation patterns, but overlook that features are trained to reconstruct activations that serve computational roles in the forward pass. We introduce a novel weight-based interpretation framework that measures functional effects through direct weight interactions, requiring no activation data. Through three experiments on Gemma-2 and Llama-3.1 models, we demonstrate that (1) 1/4 of features directly predict output tokens, (2) features actively participate in attention mechanisms with depth-dependent structure, and (3) semantic and non-semantic feature populations exhibit distinct distribution profiles in attention circuits. Our analysis provides the missing out-of-context half of SAE feature interpretability.

Abstract: RLVR is now a standard way to train LLMs on reasoning tasks with verifiable outcomes, but when rollout generation dominates the cost, efficiency depends heavily on which prompts you sample and when. In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models have recently emerged as a powerful generative paradigm, yet their generalization properties remain understudied compared to their auto-regressive counterparts. In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe performance gains peaking at $8.8\%$ and $5.8\%$, respectively, on 8B-parameter models, confirming the scalability and effectiveness of our framework in large-scale masked diffusion language model regimes.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims at removing the influence of specific data from a pretrained model while preserving performance on the remaining data. In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) aims to discover bioactive ligands. Conventional approaches construct probability paths separately in Euclidean and probabilistic spaces for continuous atomic coordinates and discrete chemical categories, leading to a mismatch with the underlying statistical manifolds. We address this issue from an information-geometric perspective by modeling molecules as composite exponential-family distributions and defining generative flows along exponential geodesics under the Fisher-Rao metric. To avoid the instantaneous trajectory collapse induced by geodesics directly targeting Dirac distributions, we propose Evolving Exponential Geodesic Flow for SBDD (EvoEGF-Mol), which replaces static Dirac targets with dynamically concentrating distributions, ensuring stable training via a progressive-parameter-refinement architecture. Our model approaches a reference-level PoseBusters passing rate (93.4%) on CrossDock, demonstrating remarkable geometric precision and interaction fidelity, while outperforming baselines on real-world MolGenBench tasks by recovering bioactive scaffolds and generating candidates that meet established MedChem filters.

Abstract: Latent learning, classically theorized by Tolman, shows that biological agents (e.g., rats) can acquire internal representations of their environment without rewards, enabling rapid adaptation once rewards are introduced. In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics. Specifically, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple model families and diverse task domains to establish the existence of the latent learning dynamics in LLMs.

Abstract: Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to develop lifelong learning agents to continuously acquire knowledge across diverse tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models trained via next-token prediction are fundamentally pattern-matchers: sensitive to superficial phrasing variations even when the underlying problem is identical. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent Pass@k improvements, with gains up to 9.84 points on competition math (AMC12, AIME24) and 5.05 points on out-of-distribution scientific reasoning (GPQA-Diamond).

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance by scaling test-time compute, they frequently suffer from Cognitive Inertia, a failure pattern manifesting as either overthinking (inertia of motion) or reasoning rigidity (inertia of direction). Existing detection methods, typically relying on superficial textual heuristics like self-correction tokens, often fail to capture the model's unvoiced internal conflicts. To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks confirm that STARS efficiently curtails redundant loops while improving accuracy through the adaptive correction of erroneous trajectories. STARS offers a robust, unsupervised mechanism to optimize the reasoning process of LRMs without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hierarchical policies in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) addresses long-horizon tasks by decomposing control into high-level subgoal planning and low-level action execution. A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations. Our experimental results a popular benchmark demonstrate that our actor-derived representations consistently outperform representations learned via value estimation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning flow matching models is a central challenge in settings with limited data, evolving distributions, or strict efficiency demands, where unconstrained fine-tuning can erode the accuracy and efficiency gains learned during pretraining. Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning. Our results position GFT as a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative for scalable adaptation of flow matching models under distribution shift.

Abstract: Existing neural solvers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are typically trained either in a one-off manner on a fixed set of pre-defined tasks or in a lifelong manner on several tasks arriving sequentially, assuming sufficient training on each task. Both settings overlook a common real-world property: problem patterns may drift continually over time, yielding massive tasks sequentially arising while offering only limited training resources per task. In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift. Extensive experiments show that, under such continual drift, DREE effectively learns new tasks, preserves prior knowledge, improves generalization to unseen tasks, and can be applied to diverse existing neural solvers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit unexpected errors or unintended behavior, even at scale. While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and complex neurodegenerative disorder influenced by genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD.

Abstract: Because of the pervasive use of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in high-stakes domains, the interpretability of DNNs has received increased attention. The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \textbf{REKD} (\textbf{R}ationale \textbf{E}xtraction with \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.

Abstract: Recently, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and visible light communication (VLC) technologies has emerged as a promising solution to offer flexible communication and efficient lighting. This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.

Abstract: The reinforcement fine-tuning area is undergoing an explosion papers largely on optimizing design choices. Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.

Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Graph generation aims to sample discrete node and edge attributes while satisfying coupled structural constraints. Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions. Each Bayesian update reduces to solving a symmetric positive definite linear system, enabling coupled node and edge updates within a single fusion step. We construct sample-agnostic sparse precisions from a representation-induced dependency graph, thereby avoiding label leakage while enforcing node-edge consistency. On synthetic and molecular graph datasets, VBFN improves fidelity and diversity, and surpasses baseline methods.

Abstract: Federated learning offers a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving traffic prediction, yet its performance is often challenged by the non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) nature of decentralized traffic data. Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.

Abstract: Group-relative policy optimization methods train language models by generating multiple rollouts per prompt and normalizing rewards with a shared mean reward baseline. In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing raw data, but privacy regulations such as the right to be forgotten require FL systems to remove the influence of previously used training data upon request. Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines.

Abstract: We study Learning to Defer for non-stationary time series with partial feedback and time-varying expert availability. At each time step, the router selects an available expert, observes the target, and sees only the queried expert's prediction. We model signed expert residuals using L2D-SLDS, a factorized switching linear-Gaussian state-space model with context-dependent regime transitions, a shared global factor enabling cross-expert information transfer, and per-expert idiosyncratic states. The model supports expert entry and pruning via a dynamic registry. Using one-step-ahead predictive beliefs, we propose an IDS-inspired routing rule that trades off predicted cost against information gained about the latent regime and shared factor. Experiments show improvements over contextual-bandit baselines and a no-shared-factor ablation.

Abstract: Humans learn efficiently from their environment by engaging multiple interacting neural systems that support distinct yet complementary forms of control, including model-based (goal-directed) planning, model-free (habitual) responding, and episodic memory-based learning. Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Test-Time Training offers a promising way to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by adapting the model using only the test questions. However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving. Our code and implementation details are available at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/TTCS.

Abstract: Deep learning has been proposed as an efficient alternative for the numerical approximation of PDE solutions, offering fast, iterative simulation of PDEs through the approximation of solution operators. However, deep learning solutions have struggle to perform well over long prediction durations due to the accumulation of auto-regressive error, which is compounded by the inability of models to conserve physical quantities. In this work, we present conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for incorporation physical conservation criteria within deep learning models. Our results demonstrate consistent improvement in the long-term stability of auto-regressive neural operator models, regardless of the model architecture. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of neural operators from the spectral domain, highlighting significant limitations of present architectures. These results highlight the need for future work to consider architectures that place specific emphasis on high frequency components, which are integral to the understanding and modeling of turbulent flows.

Abstract: The application of data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has long been constrained by the availability of large amount of degradation data. Mainstream solutions such as domain adaptation and meta-learning still rely on large amounts of historical degradation data from equipment that is identical or similar to the target, which imposes significant limitations in practical applications. This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\% of samples of target equipment are used. Meanwhile, it substantially outperforms conventional supervised and few-shot approaches while markedly reducing the data required to achieve high predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Training-data attribution for vision generative models aims to identify which training data influenced a given output. While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks. However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity. We release the source code to support future research.

Abstract: Malicious bots pose a growing threat to e-commerce platforms by scraping data, hoarding inventory, and perpetrating fraud. Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.

Abstract: IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis. The implementation, dataset generation scripts, and the interactive inference application are publicly available at: https://github.com/riteshbhadana/IR-Drop-Predictor.

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) have rapidly gained traction as an important component in the pre-training pipelines of leading Vision-Language-Action models. However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.

Abstract: Current quantization methods for LLMs predominantly rely on block-wise structures to maintain efficiency, often at the cost of representational flexibility. In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By "breaking the blocks" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-graph learning is crucial for extracting meaningful signals from collections of heterogeneous graphs. However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries. Our work establishes MGMT as a unified framework for structured multi-graph learning, advancing representation techniques in domains where graph-based data plays a central role.

Abstract: Causal inference from observational data provides strong evidence for the best action in decision-making without performing expensive randomized trials. The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification.

Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) aims to erase designated client-level, class-level, or sample-level knowledge from a global model. Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.

Abstract: Hierarchical sequence models replace fixed tokenization with learned segmentations that compress long byte sequences for efficient autoregressive modeling. While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.

Abstract: Large-scale Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases have become indispensable in supporting clinical decision-making through data-driven treatment recommendations. However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients.

Abstract: Standard attention-based transformers are known to exhibit instability under learning rate overspecification during training, particularly at high learning rates. While various methods have been proposed to improve resilience to such overspecification by modifying the optimization procedure, fundamental architectural innovations to this end remain underexplored. In this work, we illustrate that the consensus mechanism, a drop-in replacement for attention, stabilizes transformer training across a wider effective range of learning rates. We formulate consensus as a graphical model and provide extensive empirical analysis demonstrating improved stability across learning rate sweeps on text, DNA, and protein modalities. We further propose a hybrid consensus-attention framework that preserves performance while improving stability. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing the properties of consensus.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning of style-conditioned policies using explicit style supervision via subtrajectory labeling functions. In this setting, aligning style with high task performance is particularly challenging due to distribution shift and inherent conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods, despite introducing numerous definitions of style, often fail to reconcile these objectives effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autoregressive sequence modeling stands as the cornerstone of modern Generative AI, powering results across diverse modalities ranging from text generation to image generation. However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of "memory-dense" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets.

Abstract: Perplexity -- a function measuring a model's overall level of "surprise" when encountering a particular output -- has gained significant traction in recent years, both as a loss function and as a simple-to-compute metric of model quality. Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, yet their stochastic next-token prediction creates logical inconsistencies and reward hacking that formal symbolic systems avoid. To bridge this gap, we introduce a formal logic verification-guided framework that dynamically interleaves formal symbolic verification with the natural language generation process, providing real-time feedback to detect and rectify errors as they occur. Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization. Extensive evaluation on six benchmarks spanning mathematical, logical, and general reasoning demonstrates that our 7B and 14B models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by average margins of 10.4% and 14.2%, respectively. These results validate that formal verification can serve as a scalable mechanism to significantly push the performance boundaries of advanced LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Policies learned via continuous actor-critic methods often exhibit erratic, high-frequency oscillations, making them unsuitable for physical deployment. Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, the hardware and computational costs for training LLMs are also significantly burdensome. Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency.

Abstract: We investigate progressive freezing as an alternative to straight-through estimators (STE) for training binary networks from scratch. Under controlled training conditions, we find that while global progressive freezing works for binary-weight networks, it fails for full binary neural networks due to activation-induced gradient blockades. We introduce StoMPP (Stochastic Masked Partial Progressive Binarization), which uses layerwise stochastic masking to progressively replace differentiable clipped weights/activations with hard binary step functions, while only backpropagating through the unfrozen (clipped) subset (i.e., no straight-through estimator). Under a matched minimal training recipe, StoMPP improves accuracy over a BinaryConnect-style STE baseline, with gains that increase with depth (e.g., for ResNet-50 BNN: +18.0 on CIFAR-10, +13.5 on CIFAR-100, and +3.8 on ImageNet; for ResNet-18: +3.1, +4.7, and +1.3). For binary-weight networks, StoMPP achieves 91.2\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 69.5\% on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50. We analyze training dynamics under progressive freezing, revealing non-monotonic convergence and improved depth scaling under binarization constraints.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) relies on policy constraints to mitigate extrapolation error, where both the constraint form and constraint strength critically shape performance. However, most existing methods commit to a single constraint family: weighted behavior cloning, density regularization, or support constraints, without a unified principle that explains their connections or trade-offs. In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection. Experiments on D4RL and NeoRL2 demonstrate robust gains across diverse domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance overall.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates decentralized collaborative learning without transmitting raw data. However, reliance on fixed global rounds or validation data for hyperparameter tuning hinders practical deployment by incurring high computational costs and privacy risks. To address this, we propose a data-free early stopping framework that determines the optimal stopping point by monitoring the task vector's growth rate using solely server-side parameters. The numerical results on skin lesion/blood cell classification demonstrate that our approach is comparable to validation-based early stopping across various state-of-the-art FL methods. In particular, the proposed framework spends an average of 47/20 (skin lesion/blood cell) rounds to achieve over 12.5%/10.3% higher performance than early stopping based on validation data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an early stopping framework for FL methods without using any validation data.

Abstract: Reliable control of myoelectric prostheses is often hindered by high inter-subject variability and the clinical impracticality of high-density sensor arrays. This study proposes a deep learning framework for accurate gesture recognition using only two surface electromyography (sEMG) channels. The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining. By combining high precision with minimal computational and sensor overhead, this framework provides a scalable and efficient approach for the next generation of affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems.

Abstract: Full-graph and mini-batch Graph Neural Network (GNN) training approaches have distinct system design demands, making it crucial to choose the appropriate approach to develop. A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings. The implementation can be found in the github link: https://github.com/LIUMENGFAN-gif/GNN_fullgraph_minibatch_training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Differentiable matching layers, often implemented via entropy-regularized Optimal Transport, serve as a critical approximate inference mechanism in structural prediction. However, recovering discrete permutations via annealing $ε\to 0$ is notoriously unstable. We identify a fundamental mechanism for this failure: \textbf{Premature Mode Collapse}. By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/ε)$. This mismatch inevitably forces the inference trajectory into spurious local basins. To address this, we propose \textbf{Efficient PH-ASC}, an adaptive scheduling algorithm that monitors the stability of the inference process. By enforcing a linear stability law, we decouple expensive spectral diagnostics from the training loop, reducing overhead from $O(N^3)$ to amortized $O(1)$. Our implementation and interactive demo are available at https://github.com/xxx0438/torch-sinkhorn-asc and https://huggingface.co/spaces/leon0923/torch-sinkhorn-asc-demo. bounded away from zero in generic training dynamics unless the feature extractor converges unrealistically fast.

Abstract: Consistency models have been proposed for fast generative modeling, achieving results competitive with diffusion and flow models. However, these methods exhibit inherent instability and limited reproducibility when training from scratch, motivating subsequent work to explain and stabilize these issues. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization. We further demonstrate that our strategy extends beyond image generation to diffusion-based policy learning, without reliance on a pretrained diffusion model for initialization, thereby illustrating its broader applicability.

Abstract: Generating realistic graph-structured data is challenging due to discrete structures, variable sizes, and class-specific connectivity patterns that resist conventional generative modelling. While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

Abstract: Computing the importance of features in supervised classification tasks is critical for model interpretability. Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.
  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) in medicine has transitioned from research to concrete applications aimed at supporting several medical purposes like therapy selection, monitoring and treatment. Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics. Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases. We demonstrate the impact of our approach exemplarily on the PTB-XL ECG-dataset. This is a first step to enable fit-for-purpose evaluation of training and test data in practice as the base for establishing trustworthy AI in medicine.

Abstract: The prevailing Direct Forecasting (DF) paradigm dominates Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) by forcing models to predict the entire future horizon in a single forward pass. While efficient, this rigid coupling of output and evaluation horizons necessitates computationally prohibitive re-training for every target horizon. In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation. This work propels a paradigm shift in LTSF: moving from passive Static Mapping to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning.

Abstract: Despite huge successes on a wide range of tasks, neural networks are known to sometimes struggle to generalise to unseen data. Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a fundamental parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that balances efficiency and performance in large-scale neural networks. However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters. Our results uncover several findings, notably: LoRA and its variants exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the choices of learning rate compared to other hyperparameters; moreover, with proper hyperparameter configurations, LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the performance of most of its variants.

Abstract: The integrity of time in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices is crucial for reliable operation in energy cyber-physical systems, such as smart grids and microgrids. However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.

Abstract: Early-exit neural networks have become popular for reducing inference latency by allowing intermediate predictions when sufficient confidence is achieved. However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.

Abstract: Pain management in intensive care usually involves complex trade-offs between therapeutic goals and patient safety, since both inadequate and excessive treatment may induce serious sequelae. Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.

Abstract: Information-based data selection for instruction tuning is compelling: maximizing the log-determinant of the Fisher information yields a monotone submodular objective, enabling greedy algorithms to achieve a $(1-1/e)$ approximation under a cardinality budget. In practice, however, we identify alleviating gradient conflicts, misalignment between per-sample gradients, is a key factor that slows down the decay of marginal log-determinant information gains, thereby preventing significant loss of information. We formalize this via an $\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning. This achieves performance improvements with substantially lower training cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve difficult problems by producing "reasoning traces" before emitting a final response. However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic "reasoning style" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.

In this work, we show that models with stronger generalization also align more strongly with human neural activity. Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects. Finally, we find that increasing model capacity and training data scale systematically reduces local intrinsic dimension, providing a geometric account of the benefits of scaling. Together, our results identify local intrinsic dimension as a unifying descriptor of representational convergence in artificial and biological systems.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs.

Abstract: Understanding what graph neural networks can learn, especially their ability to learn to execute algorithms, remains a central theoretical challenge. In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.

Abstract: The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance. Together, these results establish a principled foundation and offer practical guidance for loss selections in large-class machine learning applications.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.
  In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Physical systems near singularities, interfaces, and critical points exhibit power-law scaling, yet standard neural networks leave the governing exponents implicit. We introduce physics-informed M"untz-Sz'asz Networks (MSN-PINN), a power-law basis network that treats scaling exponents as trainable parameters. The model outputs both the solution and its scaling structure. We prove identifiability, or unique recovery, and show that, under these conditions, the squared error between learned and true exponents scales as $O(|μ- α|^2)$. Across experiments, MSN-PINN achieves single-exponent recovery with 1--5% error under noise and sparse sampling. It recovers corner singularity exponents for the two-dimensional Laplace equation with 0.009% error, matches the classical result of Kondrat'ev (1967), and recovers forcing-induced exponents in singular Poisson problems with 0.03% and 0.05% errors. On a 40-configuration wedge benchmark, it reaches a 100% success rate with 0.022% mean error. Constraint-aware training encodes physical requirements such as boundary condition compatibility and improves accuracy by three orders of magnitude over naive training. By combining the expressiveness of neural networks with the interpretability of asymptotic analysis, MSN-PINN produces learned parameters with direct physical meaning.

Abstract: We propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings. In this view, self-attention implements a gradient step of an interaction energy, while MLP layers correspond to gradient updates of a potential energy. Standard GPT-style transformers emerge as vanilla gradient descent on the resulting composite objective, implemented via Lie--Trotter splitting between these two energy functionals. This perspective enables principled architectural design using classical optimization ideas. As a proof of concept, we introduce a Nesterov-style accelerated transformer that preserves the same attention and MLP oracles. The resulting architecture consistently outperforms a nanoGPT baseline on TinyStories and OpenWebText, demonstrating that optimization-theoretic insights can translate into practical gains.

Abstract: We propose Obfuscated Semantic Null space Injection for Privacy (OSNIP), a lightweight client-side encryption framework for privacy-preserving LLM inference. Generalizing the geometric intuition of linear kernels to the high-dimensional latent space of LLMs, we formally define the ``Obfuscated Semantic Null Space'', a high-dimensional regime that preserves semantic fidelity while enforcing near-orthogonality to the original embedding. By injecting perturbations that project the original embedding into this space, OSNIP ensures privacy without any post-processing. Furthermore, OSNIP employs a key-dependent stochastic mapping that synthesizes individualized perturbation trajectories unique to each user. Evaluations on 12 generative and classification benchmarks show that OSNIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, sharply reducing attack success rates while maintaining strong model utility under strict security constraints.

Abstract: Recent works on language identification and generation have established tight statistical rates at which these tasks can be achieved. These works typically operate under a strong realizability assumption: that the input data is drawn from an unknown distribution necessarily supported on some language in a given collection. In this work, we relax this assumption of realizability entirely, and impose no restrictions on the distribution of the input data. We propose objectives to study both language identification and generation in this more general "agnostic" setup. Across both problems, we obtain novel interesting characterizations and nearly tight rates.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often generalize well despite heavy over-parameterization, challenging classical parameter-based analyses. We study generalization from a representation-centric perspective and analyze how the geometry of learned embeddings controls predictive performance for a fixed trained model. We show that population risk can be bounded by two factors: (i) the intrinsic dimension of the embedding distribution, which determines the convergence rate of empirical embedding distribution to the population distribution in Wasserstein distance, and (ii) the sensitivity of the downstream mapping from embeddings to predictions, characterized by Lipschitz constants. Together, these yield an embedding-dependent error bound that does not rely on parameter counts or hypothesis class complexity. At the final embedding layer, architectural sensitivity vanishes and the bound is dominated by embedding dimension, explaining its strong empirical correlation with generalization performance. Experiments across architectures and datasets validate the theory and demonstrate the utility of embedding-based diagnostics.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated strong empirical performance in pre-training large language models by performing matrix-level gradient (or momentum) orthogonalization in each layer independently. In this work, we propose TEON, a principled generalization of Muon that extends orthogonalization beyond individual layers by modeling the gradients of a neural network as a structured higher-order tensor. We present TEON's improved convergence guarantee over layer-wise Muon, and further develop a practical instantiation of TEON based on the theoretical analysis with corresponding ablation. We evaluate our approach on two widely adopted architectures: GPT-style models, ranging from 130M to 774M parameters, and LLaMA-style models, ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. Experimental results show that TEON consistently improves training and validation perplexity across model scales and exhibits strong robustness under various approximate SVD schemes.

Abstract: Molecular generative models, often employing GPT-style language modeling on molecular string representations, have shown promising capabilities when scaled to large datasets and model sizes. However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation. Our results demonstrate clear scaling laws in molecular models for both pretraining and downstream transfer, reveal the substantial impact of molecular representation on performance, and explain previously observed inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation. Additionally, we publicly release the largest library of molecular language models to date to facilitate future research and development. Code and models are available at https://github.com/SZU-ADDG/MLM-Scaling.

Abstract: Recent work has revealed a link between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and test-time kernel regression via the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, with standard softmax attention corresponding to a Gaussian kernel. However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $α$-entmax attention with $α= 1 + \frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \to \infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become central to post-training large language models, yet dominant algorithms rely on clipping mechanisms that introduce optimization issues at scale, including zero-gradient regions, reward hacking, and training instability. We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.

Abstract: The NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fully-quantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet-II .

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have recently been adapted to tabular data containing discrete and continuous features. However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound. The results indicate that our model generates significantly more realistic samples and captures distributional details more accurately, for example, the detection score increases by 40%.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in vision-language models (VLMs) faces significant challenges in improving task adaptation and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight.

Abstract: Flow-based models have proven successful for time-series generation, particularly when defined in lower-dimensional latent spaces that enable efficient sampling. However, how to design latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generative modelling remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling. We show that these equivariance-regularised latent spaces improve generation quality while preserving the computational advantages of latent flow models. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based baselines in standard time-series generation metrics, while achieving orders-of-magnitude faster sampling. These results highlight the practical benefits of incorporating geometric inductive biases into latent generative models for time series.

Abstract: Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MAGs) have been widely adopted for modeling complex systems by integrating multi-modal information, such as text and images, on nodes. However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image). The source code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising candidate for energy-efficient LLM inference. However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency.

Abstract: Time series data are essential for a wide range of applications, particularly in developing robust machine learning models. However, access to high-quality datasets is often limited due to privacy concerns, acquisition costs, and labeling challenges. Synthetic time series generation has emerged as a promising solution to address these constraints. In this work, we present a framework for generating synthetic time series by leveraging complex networks mappings. Specifically, we investigate whether time series transformed into Quantile Graphs (QG) -- and then reconstructed via inverse mapping -- can produce synthetic data that preserve the statistical and structural properties of the original. We evaluate the fidelity and utility of the generated data using both simulated and real-world datasets, and compare our approach against state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methods. Results indicate that our quantile graph-based methodology offers a competitive and interpretable alternative for synthetic time series generation.

Abstract: A central challenge in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) is to train generalist policies capable of performing tasks not seen during training. To facilitate such generalization, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently emerged as a powerful formalism for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks to RL agents. While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or "symbols"), which describe high-level events in LTL. We present PlatoLTL, a novel approach that enables policies to zero-shot generalize not only compositionally across LTL formula structures, but also parametrically across propositions. We achieve this by treating propositions as instances of parameterized predicates rather than discrete symbols, allowing policies to learn shared structure across related propositions. We propose a novel architecture that embeds and composes predicates to represent LTL specifications, and demonstrate successful zero-shot generalization to novel propositions and tasks across challenging environments.

Abstract: The goal of probabilistic prediction is to issue predictive distributions that are as informative as possible, subject to being calibrated. Despite substantial progress in the univariate setting, achieving multivariate calibration remains challenging. Recent work has introduced pre-rank functions, scalar projections of multivariate forecasts and observations, as flexible diagnostics for assessing specific aspects of multivariate calibration, but their use has largely been limited to post-hoc evaluation. We propose a regularization-based calibration method that enforces multivariate calibration during training of multivariate distributional regression models using pre-rank functions. We further introduce a novel PCA-based pre-rank that projects predictions onto principal directions of the predictive distribution. Through simulation studies and experiments on 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that the proposed approach substantially improves multivariate pre-rank calibration without compromising predictive accuracy, and that the PCA pre-rank reveals dependence-structure misspecifications that are not detected by existing pre-ranks.

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used due to their interpretability and efficiency, but they struggle in regression tasks that require reliable extrapolation and well-calibrated uncertainty. Piecewise-constant leaf predictions are bounded by the training targets and often become overconfident under distribution shift. We propose a single-tree Bayesian model that extends VSPYCT by equipping each leaf with a GP predictor. Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf. Experiments on benchmark regression tasks show improvements in the predictive performance compared to standard variational oblique trees, and substantial performance gains in extrapolation scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT. Extensive experiments show that FlexLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning.

Abstract: We study a sampling problem whose target distribution is $π\propto \exp(-f-r)$ where the data fidelity term $f$ is Lipschitz smooth while the regularizer term $r=r_1-r_2$ is a non-smooth difference-of-convex (DC) function, i.e., $r_1,r_2$ are convex. By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA). We establish convergence of DC-LA to the target distribution $π$, up to discretization and smoothing errors, in the $q$-Wasserstein distance for all $q \in \mathbb{N}^*$, under the assumption that $V$ is distant dissipative. Our results improve previous work on non-log-concave sampling in terms of a more general framework and assumptions. Numerical experiments show that DC-LA produces accurate distributions in synthetic settings and reliably provides uncertainty quantification in a real-world Computed Tomography application.

Abstract: Graph coarsening reduces the size of a graph while preserving certain properties. Most existing methods preserve either spectral or spatial characteristics. Recent research has shown that preserving topological features helps maintain the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on the coarsened graph but suffers from exponential time complexity. To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology. STPGC comprises three new algorithms, GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, and NeighborhoodConing based on these two concepts, which eliminate dominated nodes and edges while rigorously preserving topological features. We further prove that STPGC preserves the GNN receptive field and develop approximate algorithms to accelerate GNN training. Experiments on node classification with GNNs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of STPGC.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains challenging when models simultaneously encounter correlation shifts across environments and diversity shifts driven by rare or hard samples. Existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods primarily address spurious correlations at the environment level, but often overlook sample-level heterogeneity within environments, which can critically impact OOD performance. In this work, we propose \emph{Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization} (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift. By integrating environment-level invariance with within-environment robustness, the proposed approach makes these two mechanisms complementary under mixed distribution shifts. We further extend the framework to scenarios without explicit environment annotations by inferring latent environments through a minimax formulation. Experiments across regression, tabular, time-series, and image classification benchmarks under mixed distribution shifts demonstrate consistent improvements in both worst-environment and average OOD performance.

Abstract: Nash regret has recently emerged as a principled fairness-aware performance metric for stochastic multi-armed bandits, motivated by the Nash Social Welfare objective. Although this notion has been extended to linear bandits, existing results suffer from suboptimality in ambient dimension $d$, stemming from proof techniques that rely on restrictive concentration inequalities. In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$. Extensive experiments on linear bandit instances generated from real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art baseline.

Abstract: Structured sparsity has emerged as a popular model pruning technique, widely adopted in various architectures, including CNNs, Transformer models, and especially large language models (LLMs) in recent years. A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.
  In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator. We extensively validate our approach on vision and language Transformers, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art permutation results for structured sparsity.

Abstract: We propose dgMARK, a decoding-guided watermarking method for discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs). Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs can generate tokens in arbitrary order. While an ideal conditional predictor would be invariant to this order, practical dLLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to the unmasking order, creating a new channel for watermarking. dgMARK steers the unmasking order toward positions whose high-reward candidate tokens satisfy a simple parity constraint induced by a binary hash, without explicitly reweighting the model's learned probabilities. The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant. Watermarks are detected via elevated parity-matching statistics, and a sliding-window detector ensures robustness under post-editing operations including insertion, deletion, substitution, and paraphrasing.

Abstract: We introduce the Value-at-Risk Constrained Policy Optimization algorithm (VaR-CPO), a sample efficient and conservative method designed to optimize Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraints directly. Empirically, we demonstrate that VaR-CPO is capable of safe exploration, achieving zero constraint violations during training in feasible environments, a critical property that baseline methods fail to uphold. To overcome the inherent non-differentiability of the VaR constraint, we employ the one-sided Chebyshev inequality to obtain a tractable surrogate based on the first two moments of the cost return. Additionally, by extending the trust-region framework of the Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO) method, we provide rigorous worst-case bounds for both policy improvement and constraint violation during the training process.

Abstract: Memory agents, which depart from predefined memory-processing pipelines by endogenously managing the processing, storage, and retrieval of memories, have garnered increasing attention for their autonomy and adaptability. However, existing training paradigms remain constrained: agents often traverse long-horizon sequences of memory operations before receiving sparse and delayed rewards, which hinders truly end-to-end optimization of memory management policies. To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier and reducing inference tokens per query by $\sim24.45\%$ relative to GAM without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Root cause analysis of anomalies aims to identify those features that cause the deviation from the normal process. Existing methods ignore, however, that anomalies can arise through two fundamentally different processes: measurement errors, where data was generated normally but one or more values were recorded incorrectly, and mechanism shifts, where the causal process generating the data changed. While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration. We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent ("true") and observed ("measured") variables. We show that they are identifiable, and propose a maximum likelihood estimation approach to put this to practice. Experiments show that our method matches state-of-the-art performance in root cause localization, while it additionally enables accurate classification of anomaly types, and remains robust even when the causal DAG is unknown.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought reasoning (Long CoT) is now fundamental to state-of-the-art LLMs, especially in mathematical reasoning. However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%. Our code, SFT dataset and models are publicly available at https://github.com/amahankali10/DC_CoT_RL_for_Low_Latency_CoT_with_Parallel_Reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, where group-based approaches such as GRPO have emerged as efficient paradigms that optimize policies by leveraging intra-group performance differences. However, these methods typically rely on absolute numerical rewards, introducing intrinsic limitations. In verifiable tasks, identical group evaluations often result in sparse supervision, while in open-ended scenarios, the score range instability of reward models undermines advantage estimation based on group means. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings. By transforming raw evaluations into robust relative signals, RLRR effectively mitigates signal sparsity and reward instability. Experimental results demonstrate that RLRR yields consistent performance improvements over standard group-based baselines across reasoning benchmarks and open-ended generation tasks.

Abstract: Flow matching is a scalable generative framework for characterizing continuous normalizing flows with wide-range applications. However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since naïve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines. Our code is available at: https://github.com/santanurathod/SplineFlow.

Abstract: On-policy deep reinforcement learning remains a dominant paradigm for continuous control, yet standard implementations rely on Gaussian actors and relatively shallow MLP policies, often leading to brittle optimization when gradients are noisy and policy updates must be conservative. In this paper, we revisit policy representation as a first-class design choice for on-policy optimization. We study discretized categorical actors that represent each action dimension with a distribution over bins, yielding a policy objective that resembles a cross-entropy loss. Building on architectural advances from supervised learning, we further propose regularized actor networks, while keeping critic design fixed. Our results show that simply replacing the standard actor network with our discretized regularized actor yields consistent gains and achieve the state-of-the-art performance across diverse continuous-control benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make accurate next token predictions but their confidence in these predictions can be poorly calibrated: high-confidence predictions are frequently wrong, and low-confidence predictions may be correct. This miscalibration is exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods breaking the link between predictive probability and correctness. We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets. We also introduce Confidence@k, a test-time scaling mechanism leveraging calibrated token probabilities for Bayes-optimal selection of output tokens.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty is critical for the safe deployment of ranking models in real-world applications. Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DCR, reducing average prediction set size by up to 36%, while maintaining valid coverage.

Abstract: Generative models have enjoyed widespread success in a variety of applications. However, they encounter inherent mathematical limitations in modeling distributions where samples are constrained by equalities, as is frequently the setting in scientific domains. In this work, we develop a computationally cheap, mathematically justified, and highly flexible distributional modification for combating known pitfalls in equality-constrained generative models. We propose perturbing the data distribution in a constraint-aware way such that the new distribution has support matching the ambient space dimension while still implicitly incorporating underlying manifold geometry. Through theoretical analyses and empirical evidence on several representative tasks, we illustrate that our approach consistently enables data distribution recovery and stable sampling with both diffusion models and normalizing flows.

Abstract: As artificial neural networks, and specifically large language models, have improved rapidly in capabilities and quality, they have increasingly been deployed in real-world applications, from customer service to Google search, despite the fact that they frequently make factually incorrect or undesirable statements. This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update. The code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/behemoth.git.

Abstract: We consider the problem of unsupervised skill segmentation and hierarchical structure discovery in reinforcement learning. While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: We study the stochastic linear bandits with parameter noise model, in which the reward of action $a$ is $a^\top θ$ where $θ$ is sampled i.i.d. We show a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{O} (\sqrt{d T \log (K/δ) σ^2_{\max})}$ for a horizon $T$, general action set of size $K$ of dimension $d$, and where $σ^2_{\max}$ is the maximal variance of the reward for any action. We further provide a lower bound of $\widetildeΩ (d \sqrt{T σ^2_{\max}})$ which is tight (up to logarithmic factors) whenever $\log (K) \approx d$. For more specific action sets, $\ell_p$ unit balls with $p \leq 2$ and dual norm $q$, we show that the minimax regret is $\widetildeΘ (\sqrt{dT σ^2_q)}$, where $σ^2_q$ is a variance-dependent quantity that is always at most $4$. This is in contrast to the minimax regret attainable for such sets in the classic additive noise model, where the regret is of order $d \sqrt{T}$. Surprisingly, we show that this optimal (up to logarithmic factors) regret bound is attainable using a very simple explore-exploit algorithm.

Abstract: Current neural architectures lack a principled way to handle interchangeable tokens, i.e., symbols that are semantically equivalent yet distinguishable, such as bound variables. As a result, models trained on fixed vocabularies often struggle to generalize to unseen symbols, even when the underlying semantics remain unchanged. We propose a novel Transformer-based mechanism that is provably invariant to the renaming of interchangeable tokens. Our approach employs parallel embedding streams to isolate the contribution of each interchangeable token in the input, combined with an aggregated attention mechanism that enables structured information sharing across streams. Experimental results confirm the theoretical guarantees of our method and demonstrate substantial performance gains on open-vocabulary tasks that require generalization to novel symbols.

Abstract: We present MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T), a novel architecture that combines the global modeling capabilities of Transformers with the geometric inductive bias of MeshGraphNets, while preserving a mesh-based graph representation. MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.
  We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables. Moreover, MGN-T outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on classical benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining practical efficiency, using only a fraction of the parameters required by competing baselines.

Abstract: Inference efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their serial, autoregressive generation, especially as reasoning becomes a key capability and response sequences grow longer. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a powerful solution, providing significant speed-ups through its lightweight drafting and parallel verification mechanism. While existing work has nearly saturated improvements in draft effectiveness and efficiency, this paper advances SD from a new yet critical perspective: the verification cost. We propose TriSpec, a novel ternary SD framework that, at its core, introduces a lightweight proxy to significantly reduce computational cost by approving easily verifiable draft sequences and engaging the full target model only when encountering uncertain tokens. TriSpec can be integrated with state-of-the-art SD methods like EAGLE-3 to further reduce verification costs, achieving greater acceleration. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen/LLaMA families show that TriSpec achieves up to 35\% speedup over standard SD, with up to 50\% fewer target model invocations while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Abstract: Weight Space Learning (WSL), which frames neural network weights as a data modality, is an emerging field with potential for tasks like meta-learning or transfer learning. Particularly, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a convenient testbed, where each set of weights determines the corresponding individual data sample as a mapping from coordinates to contextual values. So far, a precise theoretical explanation for the mechanism of encoding semantics of data into network weights is still missing. In this work, we deploy the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) to establish a rigorous mapping between the data space and its latent weight representation space. We analyze a framework that maps instance-specific embeddings to INR weights via a shared hypernetwork, achieving performance competitive with existing baselines on downstream classification tasks across 2D and 3D datasets. These findings offer a theoretical lens for future investigations into network weights.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Air pollution is a chronic problem in large cities worldwide and awareness is rising as the long-term health implications become clearer. Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities. The model was optimised with various training samples to achieve the best predictive performance and gain insights into the relationship between pollutants and traffic. The workflow we have designed is straightforward and adaptable to other contexts, like other cities beyond the specifics of our dataset.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As acquiring reliable ground-truth labels is usually costly, or infeasible, crowdsourcing and aggregation of noisy human annotations is the typical resort. Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and corroborate the theoretical insights.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.

Abstract: Generative learning generates high dimensional data based on low dimensional conditions, also called prompts. Therefore, generative learning algorithms are eligible for solving (Bayesian) inverse problems. In this article we compare a traditional Bayesian inverse approach based on a forward regression model and a prior sampled with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with three state of the art generative learning models, namely conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, Invertible Neural Networks and Conditional Flow Matching. We apply them to a problem of gas turbine combustor design where we map six independent design parameters to three performance labels. We propose several metrics for the evaluation of this inverse design approaches and measure the accuracy of the labels of the generated designs along with the diversity. We also study the performance as a function of the training dataset size. Our benchmark has a clear winner, as Conditional Flow Matching consistently outperforms all competing approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks. The FOCUS system is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/sands-lab/FOCUS.

Abstract: We propose a data-efficient, physics-aware generative framework in function space for inverse PDE problems. Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Six Sigma Agent architecture enhances LLM reliability for enterprises through task decomposition, micro-agent sampling, and consensus voting, achieving Six Sigma standards with significant cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit probabilistic behavior, posing reliability challenges for enterprise deployment. The goal is to enhance reliability without solely depending on model scaling.

Method: The architecture consists of three components: (1) task decomposition into atomic actions, (2) micro-agent sampling with parallel execution across diverse LLMs, and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling.

Result: The system achieves exponential reliability gains, reducing error rates significantly (e.g., from 5% to 0.11% with 5 agents). Dynamic scaling to 13 agents meets the Six Sigma standard (3.4 DPMO). Evaluation shows a 14,700x reliability improvement and 80% cost reduction.

Conclusion: The Six Sigma Agent architecture demonstrates that achieving enterprise-grade reliability in AI systems is possible through principled redundancy and consensus, rather than solely relying on model scaling. It significantly improves reliability while reducing costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable capabilities yet remain fundamentally probabilistic, presenting critical reliability challenges for enterprise deployment. We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone.

TL;DR: 研究评估了LLMs在理性和情感偏差中的表现，发现理性改进与情感敏感性之间存在张力，不同引导方法在可控性和人类行为对齐上各有优劣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否表现出类似人类的（非）理性和偏见模式，以确定其在高风险决策或人类行为建模中的适用性。

Method: 通过（i）测试理性选择核心公理的基准和（ii）行为经济学和社会规范中的经典决策领域，评估多个LLM家族的表现。使用两种情感引导方法：上下文启动（ICP）和表示级引导（RLS）。

Result: 研究发现，深思熟虑的“思考”能显著提高理性并推动模型向期望值最大化发展。ICP产生强烈但难以校准的极端偏移，而RLS产生更符合心理学的模式但可靠性较低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在理性决策和情感驱动的偏差之间存在张力，改进理性的机制同时会放大对情感干预的敏感性。不同的情感引导方法在可控性和人类行为对齐之间存在权衡，这对人类行为模拟和LLM决策系统的安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as decision engines for hiring, healthcare, and economic judgment, yet real-world human judgment reflects a balance between rational deliberation and emotion-driven bias. If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate "thinking" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.

Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erdős Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erdős Problems.

Motivation: Address the high computational costs and latency of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and the uncontrollable errors in existing selective thinking strategies.

Method: Utilizes inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds and dynamically adjusts routing thresholds based on accumulated statistical evidence of safety.

Result: B-PAC reasoning reduces thinking model usage by up to 81.01% while controlling performance loss below user-specified levels.

Conclusion: B-PAC reasoning effectively reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance loss within user-specified levels, demonstrating its practical utility.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks but suffer from high computational costs and latency. While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that B-PAC reasoning significantly reduces computational overhead, decreasing thinking model usage by up to 81.01\%, while controlling the performance loss below the user-specified level.

Conclusion: CIP作为一种新的IM原则，不仅避免了传统方法的局限性，还通过最优控制理论建立了外在和内在行为之间的联系，具有理论和实践上的重要意义。

Abstract: Intrinsic Motivation (IM) is a paradigm for generating intelligent behavior without external utilities. The existing information-theoretic methods for IM are predominantly based on information transmission, which explicitly depends on the designer's choice of which random variables engage in transmission. In this work, we introduce a novel IM principle, Controllable Information Production (CIP), that avoids both external utilities and designer-specified variables. We derive the CIP objective from Optimal Control, showing a connection between extrinsic and intrinsic behaviors. CIP appears as the gap between open-loop and closed-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies, which simultaneously rewards the pursuit and regulation of chaos. We establish key theoretical properties of CIP and demonstrate its effectiveness on standard IM benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs, elucidating the core mechanisms driving their capabilities and explaining their empirical success.

Method: The paper establishes a lower bound for a single update step and derives finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, analyzing the dependence on initial model quality and sample size.

Result: Performance improves at a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ with sample size $n$, and dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with iterations $T$.

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs) can robustly overcome poor initialization by steering dynamics toward internal stability and consistency, as demonstrated by theoretical guarantees and empirical results.

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs) achieve notable success in iteratively improving alignment without external feedback. Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.

Conclusion: Darwinian Memory System (DMS) 是一种有效的自进化记忆系统，能够显著提升多模态大语言模型在 GUI 任务中的表现，无需额外训练成本或架构开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents facilitate Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation but struggle with long-horizon, cross-application tasks due to limited context windows. While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.

Abstract: Sampling-based decoding underlies complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), where decoding strategies critically shape model behavior. Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies. Experiments on multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate improved generation performance, with gains in robustness and diversity metrics.

Abstract: Urban spatio-temporal prediction under extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rain) is challenging due to event rarity and dynamics. Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR algorithms for improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs require large query budgets, which are costly. The research aims to determine if fewer, more informative queries can achieve similar or better performance by incorporating active learning into RLVR.

Method: The study introduces an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate the alignment between subjective and objective uncertainty. For offline settings, it uses the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC), while for online training, it introduces a new variant computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty.

Result: The method outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance with only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method, which integrates an uncertainty consistency metric and an online variant for active learning in RLVR, significantly reduces query costs while maintaining or improving performance. It demonstrates that fewer but more informative queries can achieve results comparable to full-dataset training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved mathematical reasoning through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks through extended chain-of-thought generation, but their reliance on lengthy intermediate steps incurs substantial computational cost. We find that the entropy of the model's output distribution in early reasoning steps reliably distinguishes correct from incorrect reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose EntroCut, a training-free method that dynamically truncates reasoning by identifying high-confidence states where reasoning can be safely terminated. To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss. Experiments on four benchmarks show that EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared with existing training-free methods. These results demonstrate that entropy-guided dynamic truncation provides a practical approach to mitigate the inefficiency of LRMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements have increasingly focused on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to construct autonomous agents for complex problem-solving tasks. However, existing approaches predominantly employ a single-agent framework to generate search branches and estimate rewards during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning. This single-agent paradigm inherently limits exploration capabilities, often resulting in insufficient diversity among generated branches and suboptimal planning performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous langauge model assembly (SYMPHONY), a novel multi-agent planning framework that integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents. By leveraging diverse reasoning patterns across agents, SYMPHONY enhances rollout diversity and facilitates more effective exploration. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks show that SYMPHONY achieves strong performance even when instantiated with open-source LLMs deployable on consumer-grade hardware. When enhanced with cloud-based LLMs accessible via API, SYMPHONY demonstrates further improvements, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines and underscoring the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated for safety under single-shot or low-budget adversarial prompting, which underestimates real-world risk. In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides a low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research.

Abstract: Generative medical AI now appears fluent and knowledgeable enough to resemble clinical intelligence, encouraging the belief that scaling will make it safe. But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.
  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.
  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.
  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language model (LM)-based embodied agents are increasingly deployed in real-world settings. Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The key to building trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) lies in endowing them with inherent uncertainty expression capabilities to mitigate the hallucinations that restrict their high-stakes applications. However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse decision-making tasks. However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it is susceptible to reward overoptimization, in which policy models overfit to the reward model, exploit spurious reward patterns instead of faithfully capturing human intent. Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become powerful backbones for agents to autonomously operate in digital environments like the web and operating systems. However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has increasingly demonstrated strong ability to elicit reasoning behaviors in large language models (LLMs). For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.

Abstract: Large language model agents often fail to accumulate knowledge from experience, treating each task as an independent challenge. Recent methods extract experience as flattened textual knowledge, which cannot capture procedural logic of complex subtasks. They also lack maintenance mechanisms, causing repository degradation as experience accumulates. We introduce AutoRefine, a framework that extracts and maintains dual-form Experience Patterns from agent execution histories. For procedural subtasks, we extract specialized subagents with independent reasoning and memory. For static knowledge, we extract skill patterns as guidelines or code snippets. A continuous maintenance mechanism scores, prunes, and merges patterns to prevent repository degradation. Evaluated on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and TravelPlanner, AutoRefine achieves 98.4%, 70.4%, and 27.1% respectively, with 20-73% step reductions. On TravelPlanner, automatic extraction exceeds manually designed systems (27.1% vs 12.1%), demonstrating its ability to capture procedural coordination.

Abstract: Multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks through iterative information retrieval. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for search-augmented reasoning predominantly rely on sparse outcome-level rewards, leading to a "Double Homogenization Dilemma." This manifests as (1) Process homogenization, where the thinking, reasoning, and tooling involved in generation are ignored. (2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO introduces the First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism, allocating partial rewards to the step where the ground-truth answer first appears, thereby preserving process-level signals and increasing reward variance within groups without requiring external reward models or any annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average performance gains of 24% and 13.6% on Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models, respectively.

Abstract: Large-scale, high-quality interaction trajectories are essential for advancing mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.

Abstract: The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a central goal in language model development, in which consciousness-like processing could serve as a key facilitator. While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have shown strong performance through extended chain-of-thought reasoning, yet their computational cost remains significant. Probably approximately correct (PAC) reasoning provides statistical guarantees for efficient reasoning by adaptively switching between thinking and non-thinking models, but the guarantee holds only in the marginal case and does not provide exact conditional coverage. We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings. Our experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that G-PAC and C-PAC successfully achieve group-conditional risk control while maintaining substantial computational savings.

Abstract: Code verifiers play a critical role in post-verification for LLM-based code generation, yet existing supervised fine-tuning methods suffer from data scarcity, high failure rates, and poor inference efficiency. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics.

Abstract: The standard approach to representation learning on attributed graphs -- i.e., simultaneously reconstructing node attributes and graph structure -- is geometrically flawed, as it merges two potentially incompatible metric spaces. This forces a destructive alignment that erodes information about the graph's underlying generative process. To recover this lost signal, we introduce a custom variational autoencoder that separates manifold learning from structural alignment. By quantifying the metric distortion needed to map the attribute manifold onto the graph's Heat Kernel, we transform geometric conflict into an interpretable structural descriptor. Experiments show our method uncovers connectivity patterns and anomalies undetectable by conventional approaches, proving both their theoretical inadequacy and practical limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled rapid progress in automatic heuristic discovery (AHD), yet most existing methods are predominantly limited by static evaluation against fixed instance distributions, leading to potential overfitting and poor generalization under distributional shifts. We propose Algorithm Space Response Oracles (ASRO), a game-theoretic framework that reframes heuristic discovery as a program level co-evolution between solver and instance generator. ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is widely used to improve reasoning in multiple domains, yet outcome-only scalar rewards are often sparse and uninformative, especially on failed samples, where they merely indicate failure and provide no insight into why the reasoning fails. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process. Trained on sampled OpenR1-Math, the approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning and RLVR baselines in-domain and generalizes well out-of-domain.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Prevailing medical AI operates on an unrealistic ''one-shot'' model, diagnosing from a complete patient file. However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents. The code is available at https://github.com/yf-he/EvoClinician

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a cornerstone for unlocking complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training. This highlights the potential of automatically scaling up RLVR data by exploiting abundant, reasoning-rich, unverifiable internet text.

Abstract: As AI systems evolve from isolated predictors into complex, heterogeneous ecosystems of foundation models and specialized adapters, distinguishing genuine behavioral novelty from functional redundancy becomes a critical governance challenge. Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($dσ^2γ^{-2}\log(Nd/δ)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.

Abstract: Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization. Data and code are available at https://github.com/yuhao-zhan/DeepHalluBench.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems act through tools and evolve their behavior over long, stochastic interaction traces. This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure). We also show how run likelihoods enable anomaly detection as a guardrailing signal.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks by interacting with external tools, yet existing approaches depend on high-quality synthesized trajectories selected by scoring functions and sparse outcome-based rewards, providing limited and biased supervision for learning TIR. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.

Abstract: As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with more general and consequential tasks. The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.

Abstract: Large language models now solve many benchmark math problems at near-expert levels, yet this progress has not fully translated into reliable performance in real-world applications. We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs.

Abstract: Medical calculators are fundamental to quantitative, evidence-based clinical practice. However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models. Benchmark and Codes are available in https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/MedMCP-Calc.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning provides a significant performance uplift to LLMs by enabling planning, exploration, and deliberation of their actions. CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT. Our findings suggest that current practices of penalising harmful generations may inadvertently lead to a reduction in the broader monitorability of LLMs in unpredictable ways.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning tasks to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost. Code, models, and datasets are available at https://github.com/seanie12/ThinkSafe.git.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks on closed-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been increasingly explored under black-box transfer, yet prior methods are predominantly sample-specific and offer limited reusability across inputs. We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions. Across commercial MLLMs, we boost unseen-image attack success rate by +23.7\% on GPT-4o and +19.9\% on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest universal baseline.

Abstract: Time series data are integral to critical applications across domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and environmental science. While recent work has begun to explore multi-task time series question answering (QA), current benchmarks remain limited to forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce TSAQA, a novel unified benchmark designed to broaden task coverage and evaluate diverse temporal analysis capabilities. TSAQA integrates six diverse tasks under a single framework ranging from conventional analysis, including anomaly detection and classification, to advanced analysis, such as characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis. Spanning 210k samples across 13 domains, the dataset employs diverse formats, including true-or-false (TF), multiple-choice (MC), and a novel puzzling (PZ), to comprehensively assess time series analysis. Zero-shot evaluation demonstrates that these tasks are challenging for current Large Language Models (LLMs): the best-performing commercial LLM, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves an average score of only 65.08. Although instruction tuning boosts open-source performance: the best-performing open-source model, LLaMA-3.1-8B, shows significant room for improvement, highlighting the complexity of temporal analysis for LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for dynamic game content generation, but they face critical barriers, including narrative incoherence and high operational costs. Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.

Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.

Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model in sequential decision making. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty. In particular, $(s, a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\infty$ uncertainty sets form a fundamental and expressive model: they subsume classical MDPs and turn-based stochastic games. We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem. In this work, we show that a robust policy iteration algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time for $(s, a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with a constant (fixed) discount factor, resolving an important algorithmic question.
