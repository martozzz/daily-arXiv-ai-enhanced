Our proposed method reduces blind accuracy from +66.9% above random to +2.9%, eliminating the vast majority of exploitable textual shortcuts.

Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability. The fast optimization directly translates to substantial savings in time and resources.

To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB.

Recent studies have shown that applying invertible transformations to activations can significantly improve quantization robustness by reducing activation outliers; however, existing approaches are largely restricted to rotation or Hadamard-based transformations. Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of transformations under MX quantization by deriving a bound on the quantization error. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the activation distribution and the underlying quantization structure. Building on this analysis, we propose LATMiX, a method that generalizes outlier reduction to learnable invertible affine transformations optimized using standard deep learning tools.

Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a \"locked-in\" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude.

Typically, such methods introduce a target time $r$ alongside the current time $t$ to modulate outputs between a local multi-step derivative ($r = t$) and a global few-step integral ($r = 0$). However, the conventional \"one input, one output\" paradigm enforces a partition of the training budget, often allocating a significant portion (e.g., 75% in MeanFlow) solely to the multi-step objective for stability. This separation forces a trade-off: allocating sufficient samples to the multi-step objective leaves the few-step generation undertrained, which harms convergence and limits scalability. To this end, we propose Duality Models (DuMo) via a \"one input, dual output\" paradigm. Using a shared backbone with dual heads, DuMo simultaneously predicts velocity $v_t$ and flow-map $u_t$ from a single input $x_t$. This applies geometric constraints from the multi-step objective to every sample, bounding the few-step estimation without separating training objectives, thereby significantly improving stability and efficiency.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited.

Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other. We evaluate 10 frontier models on TTG, and closely match the ranking from existing benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam, without involving any human effort in creating puzzles.

CodeScaler is trained on carefully curated preference data derived from verified code problems and incorporates syntax-aware code extraction and validity-preserving reward shaping to ensure stable and robust optimization. Across five coding benchmarks, CodeScaler improves Qwen3-8B-Base by an average of +11.72 points, outperforming binary execution-based RL by +1.82 points, and enables scalable reinforcement learning on synthetic datasets without any test cases. At inference time, CodeScaler serves as an effective test-time scaling method, achieving performance comparable to unit test approaches while providing a 10-fold reduction in latency. Moreover, CodeScaler surpasses existing reward models on RM-Bench not only in the code domain (+3.3 points), but also in general and reasoning domains (+2.7 points on average).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved clinical reasoning for disease detection and structural abnormality assessment. These findings show that explicitly modeling robustness during pre-training leads to more reliable and transferable medical vision-language representations for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Robust-MMR\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u9886\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u97e7\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u91c7\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\u7b49\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u975e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "Robust-MMR\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b:1)\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565;2)\u9886\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316;3)\u6a21\u6001\u97e7\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd:VQA-RAD\u8de8\u57df\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe78.9%(\u63d0\u53473.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9);SLAKE\u548cVQA-2019\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523074.6%\u548c77.0%;\u6270\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0bVQA-RAD\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece69.1%\u5347\u81f375.6%;\u8de8\u57dfMELINDA\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece70.3%\u5347\u81f375.2%;\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6392\u5e8f\u9000\u5316\u4ece>16\u964d\u81f34.1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \\textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines.

We introduce EXACT, a new decoding-time personalization that aligns generation with limited pairwise preference feedback using a predefined set of interpretable attributes. EXACT first identifies user-specific attribute subsets by maximizing the likelihood of preferred responses in the offline stage. Then, for online inference, EXACT retrieves the most semantically relevant attributes for an incoming prompt and injects them into the context to steer generation. We establish theoretical approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions, and provably show that our similarity-based retrieval mechanism effectively mitigates contextual preference shifts, adapting to disparate tasks without pooling conflicting preferences.

We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements. Overall, this work opens a new research direction that bridges software engineering and machine learning by leveraging variability modeling for the efficient and sustainable configuration of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790LLM\u63a8\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u6280\u672f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eHugging Face Transformers\u5e93\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u914d\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Existing solutions use irregular fine-grained mixed-precision with high runtime overhead or rely on heuristics or highly constrained precision allocation strategies. In this work, we propose ScaleBITS, a mixed-precision quantization framework that enables automated, fine-grained bitwidth allocation under a memory budget while preserving hardware efficiency. Guided by a new sensitivity analysis, we introduce a hardware-aligned, block-wise weight partitioning scheme, powered by bi-directional channel reordering. We formulate global bitwidth allocation as a constrained optimization problem and develop a scalable approximation to the greedy algorithm, enabling end-to-end principled allocation.

Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \\textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit.

The recordings are analyzed to identify bird species afterwards. Machine learning methods have greatly expedited this process in a wide range of species and environments, however, existing solutions require complex models and substantial computational resources. Instead, we propose running machine learning models on inexpensive microcontroller units (MCUs) directly in the field.

However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data.

Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts.

We estimate all parameters of our model simultaneously by minimizing a loss that is based on the objective function, multi-physics potential energy functionals, and design-constraints. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework on benchmark TO problems such as compliance minimization, heat conduction optimization, and compliant mechanism design under single- and multi-material settings. Additionally, we leverage thermo-mechanical TO with single- and multi-material options as a representative multi-physics problem. We also introduce differentiation and integration schemes that dramatically accelerate the training process.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy.

This construction yields a single, interpretable knob -- the concentration matrix $\u039b$ -- that continuously controls routing entropy, replacing discrete top-$k$ selection with a smooth, geometrically principled sparsity mechanism.

Large language models (LLMs) can provide subgoal decompositions, plausible trajectories, and abstract priors that facilitate early learning. However, heavy reliance on LLM supervision introduces scalability constraints and dependence on potentially unreliable signals. We propose MIRA (Memory-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Agent), which incorporates a structured, evolving memory graph to guide early training. The graph stores decision-relevant information, including trajectory segments and subgoal structures, and is constructed from both the agent's high-return experiences and LLM outputs. This design amortizes LLM queries into a persistent memory rather than requiring continuous real-time supervision. From this memory graph, we derive a utility signal that softly adjusts advantage estimation to influence policy updates without modifying the underlying reward function. As training progresses, the agent's policy gradually surpasses the initial LLM-derived priors, and the utility term decays, preserving standard convergence guarantees. We provide theoretical analysis showing that utility-based shaping improves early-stage learning in sparse-reward environments. Empirically, MIRA outperforms RL baselines and achieves returns comparable to approaches that rely on frequent LLM supervision, while requiring substantially fewer online LLM queries.

Unlike Gaussian priors in flat space projected onto orthogonality constraints, our prior on the manifold naturally encodes the inductive bias that adapter subspaces should be well conditioned and orthogonal, while the posterior provides calibrated predictive uncertainty without recalibration. We prove formally that the tangent space approximation strictly avoids the structural variance inflation inherent in projecting from ambient space, establishing a rigorous theoretical advantage for intrinsic manifold inference.

Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees.

We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior.

We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an \"ideal band\". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately. More broadly, our framework showcases how rigorous propensity measurements can be conducted and how it yields gains over solely using capability evaluations to predict AI behaviour.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull.

To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning.

This limitation is particularly pronounced in hip fracture risk prediction, where the performance of models trained on one cohort (the source cohort) can degrade substantially when deployed in other cohorts (target cohorts). We used a shared set of clinical and DXA-derived features across three large cohorts - the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the UK Biobank (UKB), to systematically evaluate the performance of three domain adaptation methods - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Domain - Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and their combinations. For a source cohort with males only and a source cohort with females only, domain-adaptation methods consistently showed improved performance than the no-adaptation baseline (source-only training), and the use of combinations of multiple domain adaptation methods delivered the largest and most stable gains. The method that combines MMD, CORAL, and DANN achieved the highest discrimination with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 for a source cohort with males only and 0.95 for a source cohort with females only), demonstrating that integrating multiple domain adaptation methods could produce feature representations that are less sensitive to dataset differences.

It highly impacts learning outcomes and deepens inequities in education. While subsidy programs that transfer students from public to private schools offer a mechanism to alleviate congestion without capital-intensive construction, they often underperform due to fragmented data systems that hinder effective implementation. The Philippine Educational Service Contracting program, one of the world's largest educational subsidy programs, exemplifies these challenges, falling short of its goal to decongest public schools. This prevents the science-based and data-driven analyses needed to understand what shapes student enrollment flows, particularly how families respond to economic incentives and spatial constraints. We introduce a computational framework for modeling student flow patterns and simulating policy scenarios. By synthesizing heterogeneous government data across nearly 3,000 institutions, we employ a stochastic gravity model estimated via negative binomial regression to derive behavioral elasticities for distance, net tuition cost, and socioeconomic determinants. These elasticities inform a doubly constrained spatial allocation mechanism that simulates student redistribution under varying subsidy amounts while respecting both origin candidate pools and destination slot capacities. We find that geographic proximity constrains school choice four times more strongly than tuition cost and that slot capacity, not subsidy amounts, is the binding constraint. Our work demonstrates that subsidy programs alone cannot resolve systemic overcrowding, and computational modeling can empower education policymakers to make equitable, data-driven decisions by revealing the structural constraints that shape effective resource allocation, even when resources are limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In theory, one of the main problems in supervised learning is that of function approximation: that is, given some data set $\\mathcal{D}=\\{(x_j,f(x_j))\\}_{j=1}^M$, can one build a model $F\\approx f$? We introduce a method which aims to remedy several of the theoretical shortcomings of the current paradigm for supervised learning.\n  The second project deals with transfer learning, which is the study of how an approximation process or model learned on one domain can be leveraged to improve the approximation on another domain. We study such liftings of functions when the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the whole domain. We are interested in determining subsets of the target data space on which the lifting can be defined, and how the local smoothness of the function and its lifting are related.\n  The third project is concerned with the classification task in machine learning, particularly in the active learning paradigm. Classification has often been treated as an approximation problem as well, but we propose an alternative approach leveraging techniques originally introduced for signal separation problems.

Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations. Experiments first show that symmetry-breaking can accelerate early training by providing an easier learning signal, but at the expense of encouraging shortcut solutions that can cause overfitting, where the model repeatedly generates graphs that are duplicates of the training set.

However, traditional architectures often rely on auxiliary networks such as encoders in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or discriminators in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which introduce training instability, computational overhead, and risks like mode collapse. We present NeuroSQL, a new generative paradigm that eliminates the need for auxiliary networks by learning low-dimensional latent representations implicitly. NeuroSQL leverages an asymptotic approximation that expresses the latent variables as the solution to an optimal transportation problem. Specifically, NeuroSQL learns the latent variables by solving a linear assignment problem and then passes the latent information to a standalone generator. We benchmark its performance against GANs, VAEs, and a budget-matched diffusion baseline on four datasets: handwritten digits (MNIST), faces (CelebA), animal faces (AFHQ), and brain images (OASIS). Compared to VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models: (1) in terms of image quality, NeuroSQL achieves overall lower mean pixel distance between synthetic and authentic images and stronger perceptual/structural fidelity; (2) computationally, NeuroSQL requires the least training time; and (3) practically, NeuroSQL provides an effective solution for generating synthetic data with limited training samples. By embracing quantile assignment rather than an encoder, NeuroSQL provides a fast, stable, and robust way to generate synthetic data with minimal information loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study parameter-efficient domain adaptation for physics-informed self-attention based GNN, encouraging Kirchhoff-consistent behavior via a physics-based loss while restricting adaptation to low-rank updates. Specifically, we apply LoRA to attention projections with selective unfreezing of the prediction head to regulate adaptation capacity. This design yields a controllable efficiency-accuracy trade-off for physics-constrained inverse estimation under voltage-regime shift. Across multiple grid topologies, the proposed LoRA+PHead adaptation recovers near-full fine-tuning accuracy with a target-domain RMSE gap of $2.6\\times10^{-4}$ while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 85.46%. The physics-based residual remains comparable to full fine-tuning; however, relative to Full FT, LoRA+PHead reduces MV source retention by 4.7 percentage points (17.9% vs. 22.6%) under domain shift, while still enabling parameter-efficient and physically consistent AC-PF estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, inspired by studies on the structure of Green's functions for elliptic PDEs, we introduce Neural-HSS, a parameter-efficient architecture built upon the Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix structure that is provably data-efficient for a broad class of PDEs.

The unit is no longer a deterministic scalar but a distribution: computing is no longer about propagating values, but about contracting a continuous space of possibilities under constraints. Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This \"contraction\" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze \"collapse\" modes and the conditions for a \"living neuron\", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent work, Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Reconstruction (Mezentsev and Oseledets), shows that frozen LLMs can reconstruct hundreds of tokens from only two learned proto-tokens in a single forward pass, suggesting a path beyond the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for \"imposing\" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In particular, a growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct a large-scale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with state-space size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains a fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions.

Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones.

While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\\text{marg}}(\\mathbf{u}) = -\\log p(\\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int p(\\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models. Conversely, we prove that velocity-based parameterizations are inherently stable because they satisfy a bounded-gain condition that absorbs posterior uncertainty into a smooth geometric drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Ensemble approaches improve global consistency by aggregating multiple runs, but they typically lack tools for quantifying pointwise confidence in a way that combines cross-run agreement with geometric support from the learned cluster structure. We introduce CAKE (Confidence in Assignments via K-partition Ensembles), a framework that evaluates each point using two complementary statistics computed over a clustering ensemble: assignment stability and consistency of local geometric fit. These are combined into a single, interpretable score in [0,1]. Our theoretical analysis shows that CAKE remains effective under noise and separates stable from unstable points.
