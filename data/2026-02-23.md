### [1] [Reducing Text Bias in Synthetically Generated MCQAs for VLMs in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17677)
*Sutej Kulgod,Sean Ye,Sanchit Tanwar,Christoffer Heckman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，消除合成MCQA数据中的文本捷径，强制VLM基于视觉回答，使性能更真实反映感知理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在MCQA驾驶基准上存在严重问题：模型可利用合成数据中的隐藏文本线索（如词频或句法结构），而非视觉语境来回答问题，导致性能虚高。

Method: 分离正确答案与语言伪影（如词频、句法线索），并应用课程学习策略，强制模型依赖视觉信息。

Result: 方法将盲准确率从远高于随机（+66.9%）降至接近随机（+2.9%），消除了绝大多数可利用的文本捷径。经过调整的VLM在没有视觉输入时，准确率降至与已验证的人类基准相当的水平。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效消除文本捷径，使模型依赖视觉基础，确保性能准确反映感知理解，减少基准中的虚假高表现。

Abstract: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) benchmarks are an established standard for measuring Vision Language Model (VLM) performance in driving tasks. However, we observe the known phenomenon that synthetically generated MCQAs are highly susceptible to hidden textual cues that allow models to exploit linguistic patterns rather than visual context. Our results show that a VLM fine-tuned on such data can achieve accuracy comparable to human-validated benchmarks even without visual input. Our proposed method reduces blind accuracy from +66.9% above random to +2.9%, eliminating the vast majority of exploitable textual shortcuts. By decoupling the correct answer from linguistic artifacts and employing a curriculum learning strategy, we force the model to rely on visual grounding, ensuring that performance accurately reflects perceptual understanding.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box manufacturing processes, but its performance is often limited when dealing with high-dimensional multi-stage systems, where we can observe intermediate outputs. Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability. The fast optimization directly translates to substantial savings in time and resources. This highlights the importance of combining expert knowledge with structured probabilistic models for rapid process maturation.

Result: BioBridge在EC、BindingDB等蛋白质基准上表现与主流PLM相当，在MMLU、RACE等通用理解任务上达到LLM水平，展示了领域适应与通用语言能力的结合优势。

Conclusion: BioBridge通过结合蛋白质领域知识和通用推理能力，在蛋白质理解和通用理解任务上都取得了优异表现，为生物语义推理提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Protein Language Models (PLMs) often suffer from limited adaptability to multiple tasks and exhibit poor generalization across diverse biological contexts. In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the capability to interpret protein sequences and fall short in domain-specific knowledge, limiting their capacity for effective biosemantic reasoning. To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB. It also achieves results on par with LLMs on general understanding tasks like MMLU and RACE. This showcases its innovative advantage of combining domain-specific adaptability with general-purpose language competency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LATMiX方法，通过可学习可逆仿射变换改进大语言模型微尺度后训练量化，理论分析量化误差，实验证明在低位量化下比基线性能更好。

Conclusion: 本文提出了LATMiX方法，通过可学习的可逆仿射变换改进大语言模型的微尺度后训练量化，在多种零样本基准测试上相比强基线获得了一致的精度提升。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a widely used approach for reducing the memory and compute costs of large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have shown that applying invertible transformations to activations can significantly improve quantization robustness by reducing activation outliers; however, existing approaches are largely restricted to rotation or Hadamard-based transformations. Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of transformations under MX quantization by deriving a bound on the quantization error. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the activation distribution and the underlying quantization structure. Building on this analysis, we propose LATMiX, a method that generalizes outlier reduction to learnable invertible affine transformations optimized using standard deep learning tools. Experiments show consistent improvements in average accuracy for MX low-bit quantization over strong baselines on a wide range of zero-shot benchmarks, across multiple model sizes.

Abstract: Consistency-based generative models like Shortcut and MeanFlow achieve impressive results via a target-aware design for solving the Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE). Typically, such methods introduce a target time $r$ alongside the current time $t$ to modulate outputs between a local multi-step derivative ($r = t$) and a global few-step integral ($r = 0$). However, the conventional "one input, one output" paradigm enforces a partition of the training budget, often allocating a significant portion (e.g., 75% in MeanFlow) solely to the multi-step objective for stability. This separation forces a trade-off: allocating sufficient samples to the multi-step objective leaves the few-step generation undertrained, which harms convergence and limits scalability. To this end, we propose Duality Models (DuMo) via a "one input, dual output" paradigm. Using a shared backbone with dual heads, DuMo simultaneously predicts velocity $v_t$ and flow-map $u_t$ from a single input $x_t$. This applies geometric constraints from the multi-step objective to every sample, bounding the few-step estimation without separating training objectives, thereby significantly improving stability and efficiency. On ImageNet 256 $\times$ 256, a 679M Diffusion Transformer with SD-VAE achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) FID of 1.79 in just 2 steps. Code is available at: https://github.com/LINs-lab/DuMo

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of vegetation dynamics is a key enabler for data-driven decision support in precision agriculture. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven recent progress in code large language models by leveraging execution-based feedback from unit tests, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the availability and reliability of high-quality test cases. We propose CodeScaler, an execution-free reward model designed to scale both reinforcement learning training and test-time inference for code generation. CodeScaler is trained on carefully curated preference data derived from verified code problems and incorporates syntax-aware code extraction and validity-preserving reward shaping to ensure stable and robust optimization. Across five coding benchmarks, CodeScaler improves Qwen3-8B-Base by an average of +11.72 points, outperforming binary execution-based RL by +1.82 points, and enables scalable reinforcement learning on synthetic datasets without any test cases. At inference time, CodeScaler serves as an effective test-time scaling method, achieving performance comparable to unit test approaches while providing a 10-fold reduction in latency. Moreover, CodeScaler surpasses existing reward models on RM-Bench not only in the code domain (+3.3 points), but also in general and reasoning domains (+2.7 points on average).

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of multi target active debris removal (ADR) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by introducing a unified coelliptic maneuver framework that combines Hohmann transfers, safety ellipse proximity operations, and explicit refueling logic. We benchmark three distinct planning algorithms Greedy heuristic, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and deep reinforcement learning (RL) using Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a realistic orbital simulation environment featuring randomized debris fields, keep out zones, and delta V constraints. Experimental results over 100 test scenarios demonstrate that Masked PPO achieves superior mission efficiency and computational performance, visiting up to twice as many debris as Greedy and significantly outperforming MCTS in runtime. These findings underscore the promise of modern RL methods for scalable, safe, and resource efficient space mission planning, paving the way for future advancements in ADR autonomy.

TL;DR: 论文提出AnchorTree框架，利用抽象语法树作为结构锚点引导扩散语言模型生成高质量代码，解决现有方法忽略编程语言结构导致程序无法执行的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的语言模型在代码生成时往往忽视编程语言的严谨结构，导致生成的程序无法正确执行，需要一种能尊重代码结构的方法。

Method: 提出AnchorTree框架，使用抽象语法树作为层次化先验，在扩散过程中优先解析语法和语义关键令牌（如关键字、标识符），建立结构支架来引导代码生成。

Result: 基于AnchorTree的AnCoder模型家族证明，结构锚定的扩散方法能以参数高效的方式实现高质量代码生成。

Conclusion: 通过将代码的结构化先验显式整合到扩散过程中，AnchorTree提供了一种有效的方法来改善扩散语言模型在代码生成任务中的表现，确保生成的程序具备更好的结构完整性和可执行性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive code generation, enabling global planning and iterative refinement of complex program logic. However, existing approaches fail to respect the rigid structure of programming languages and, as a result, often produce broken programs that fail to execute. To address this, we introduce AnchorTree, a framework that explicitly anchors the diffusion process using structured, hierarchical priors native to code. Specifically, AnchorTree uses the abstract syntax tree to prioritize resolving syntactically and semantically salient tokens, such as keywords (e.g., if, while) and identifiers (e.g., variable names), thereby establishing a structural scaffold that guides the remaining generation. We validate this framework via AnCoder, a family of models showing that structurally anchored diffusion offers a parameter-efficient path to high-quality code generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Robust-MMR自监督预训练框架，通过引入不对称扰动感知掩码、领域一致性正则化和模态韧性约束来增强医学视觉-语言模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉-语言模型在图像设备和采集协议等域偏移下性能明显下降，现有多模态预训练方法大多忽视鲁棒性问题，将其视为下游适应问题而非预训练的核心目标。

Method: Robust-MMR框架包含:1)不对称扰动感知掩码策略;2)领域一致性正则化;3)模态韧性约束。这些设计旨在促进学习域不变表示。

Result: 在多个医学视觉-语言基准测试中显著提升性能:VQA-RAD跨域准确率达78.9%(提升3.8个百分点);SLAKE和VQA-2019分别达到74.6%和77.0%;扰动评估下VQA-RAD准确率从69.1%升至75.6%;跨域MELINDA分类准确率从70.3%升至75.2%;检索实验中平均排序退化从>16降至4.1。

Conclusion: 在预训练阶段显式建模鲁棒性能够获得更可靠且可迁移的医学视觉-语言表示，适合真实世界部署需求。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models show strong potential for joint reasoning over medical images and clinical text, but their performance often degrades under domain shift caused by variations in imaging devices, acquisition protocols, and reporting styles. Existing multi-modal pre-training methods largely overlook robustness, treating it as a downstream adaptation problem. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved clinical reasoning for disease detection and structural abnormality assessment. These findings show that explicitly modeling robustness during pre-training leads to more reliable and transferable medical vision-language representations for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial for efficient model deployment, yet its effectiveness on Ascend NPU remains under-explored compared to GPU architectures. This paper presents a case study of representative PTQ baselines applied to reasoning-oriented models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series (1.5B/7B/14B) and QwQ-32B. We evaluate four distinct algorithms, including AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant, and FlatQuant, to cover the spectrum from weight-only compression to advanced rotation-based methods. Our empirical results reveal significant platform sensitivity. While 4-bit weight-only quantization proves viable for larger models, aggressive 4-bit weight-activation schemes suffer from layer-wise calibration instability on the NPU, leading to logic collapse in long-context reasoning tasks. Conversely, standard 8-bit quantization remains numerically stable. Furthermore, a real-world INT8 deployment demonstrates that although optimized kernels reduce latency, dynamic quantization overheads currently limit end-to-end acceleration. These findings offer a practical reference for the feasibility and limitations of deploying quantized reasoning models on Ascend NPU.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Achieving personalized alignment requires adapting large language models to each user's evolving context. While decoding-time personalization offers a scalable alternative to training-time methods, existing methods largely rely on implicit, less interpretable preference representations and impose a rigid, context-agnostic user representation, failing to account for how preferences shift across prompts. We introduce EXACT, a new decoding-time personalization that aligns generation with limited pairwise preference feedback using a predefined set of interpretable attributes. EXACT first identifies user-specific attribute subsets by maximizing the likelihood of preferred responses in the offline stage. Then, for online inference, EXACT retrieves the most semantically relevant attributes for an incoming prompt and injects them into the context to steer generation. We establish theoretical approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions, and provably show that our similarity-based retrieval mechanism effectively mitigates contextual preference shifts, adapting to disparate tasks without pooling conflicting preferences. Extensive experiments on human-annotated preference datasets demonstrate that EXACT consistently outperforms strong baselines, including preference modeling accuracy and personalized generation quality.

TL;DR: 本文系统地评估了四种识别大语言模型安全区域的方法，发现这些方法识别出的安全区域重叠度较低且不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中可能存在'安全区域'——能够直接影响安全行为的参数子集，但现有识别方法的可靠性尚不清楚。

Method: 评估了四种不同参数粒度（从单个权重到整个Transformer层）的安全区域识别方法，在四个不同规模的LLM家族和十个安全识别数据集上进行测试。

Result: 识别出的安全区域重叠度较低（IoU指标显示低到中度重叠），当使用工具数据集进一步精炼时，重叠度显著下降。

Conclusion: 现有技术无法可靠地识别出稳定、与数据集无关的安全区域，这对于基于安全区域的模型安全性理解方法提出了挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often assumed to contain ``safety regions'' -- parameter subsets whose modification directly influences safety behaviors. We conduct a systematic evaluation of four safety region identification methods spanning different parameter granularities, from individual weights to entire Transformer layers, across four families of backbone LLMs with varying sizes. Using ten safety identification datasets, we find that the identified safety regions exhibit only low to moderate overlap, as measured by IoU. The overlap drops significantly when the safety regions are further refined using utility datasets (\ie non-harmful queries). These results suggest that current techniques fail to reliably identify a stable, dataset-agnostic safety region.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial computational demands raise concerns about the energy efficiency and sustainability of both training and inference. Inference, in particular, dominates total compute usage, making its optimization crucial. Recent research has explored optimization techniques and analyzed how configuration choices influence energy consumption. Yet, the vast configuration space of inference servers makes exhaustive empirical evaluation infeasible due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on this problem by treating LLMs as configurable systems and applying variability management techniques to systematically analyze inference-time configuration choices. We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements. Overall, this work opens a new research direction that bridges software engineering and machine learning by leveraging variability modeling for the efficient and sustainable configuration of LLMs.

Conclusion: ScaleBITS框架通过硬件高效的混合精度方案，成功实现了超低比特率下的有效LLM量化，为后训练量化提供了既高效又有原则性的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory and inference cost of large language models (LLMs), yet pushing the average precision below 4 bits remains challenging due to highly non-uniform weight sensitivity and the lack of principled precision allocation. Existing solutions use irregular fine-grained mixed-precision with high runtime overhead or rely on heuristics or highly constrained precision allocation strategies. In this work, we propose ScaleBITS, a mixed-precision quantization framework that enables automated, fine-grained bitwidth allocation under a memory budget while preserving hardware efficiency. Guided by a new sensitivity analysis, we introduce a hardware-aligned, block-wise weight partitioning scheme, powered by bi-directional channel reordering. We formulate global bitwidth allocation as a constrained optimization problem and develop a scalable approximation to the greedy algorithm, enabling end-to-end principled allocation. Experiments show that ScaleBITS significantly improves over uniform-precision quantization (up to +36%) and outperforms state-of-the-art sensitivity-aware baselines (up to +13%) in ultra-low-bit regime, without adding runtime overhead.

Abstract: Proposition. Let $f$ be a predictor trained on a distribution $P$ and evaluated on a shifted distribution $Q$. Under verifiable regularity and complexity constraints, the excess risk under shift admits an explicit upper bound determined by a computable shift metric and model parameters. We develop a unified framework in which (i) risk under distribution shift is certified by explicit inequalities, (ii) verification of learned models is sound for nontrivial sizes, and (iii) interpretability is enforced through identifiability conditions rather than post hoc explanations. All claims are stated with explicit assumptions. Failure modes are isolated. Non-certifiable regimes are characterized.

Method: 提出MIDAS方法：(1) 使用自注意力机制计算动态输入相关架构参数；(2) 对激活图的每个空间块局部化计算架构选择；(3) 引入无参数、拓扑感知的搜索空间，建模节点连接性并简化每节点两条入边的选择。

Result: 在DARTS搜索空间上，CIFAR-10达到97.42% top-1准确率，CIFAR-100达到83.38%。在NAS-Bench-201上能一致找到全局最优架构。在RDARTS的两个搜索空间上达到了CIFAR-10的SOTA表现。

Conclusion: MIDAS证明了动态输入相关参数和局部化架构选择的有效性，通过补丁注意力提高了候选操作的区分度，生成的输入相关参数分布具有类别感知且主要为单峰分布，为架构解码提供了可靠指导。

Abstract: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides efficient, gradient-based methods for automatically designing neural networks, yet its adoption remains limited in practice. We present MIDAS, a novel approach that modernizes DARTS by replacing static architecture parameters with dynamic, input-specific parameters computed via self-attention. To improve robustness, MIDAS (i) localizes the architecture selection by computing it separately for each spatial patch of the activation map, and (ii) introduces a parameter-free, topology-aware search space that models node connectivity and simplifies selecting the two incoming edges per node. We evaluate MIDAS on the DARTS, NAS-Bench-201, and RDARTS search spaces. In DARTS, it reaches 97.42% top-1 on CIFAR-10 and 83.38% on CIFAR-100. In NAS-Bench-201, it consistently finds globally optimal architectures. In RDARTS, it sets the state of the art on two of four search spaces on CIFAR-10. We further analyze why MIDAS works, showing that patchwise attention improves discrimination among candidate operations, and the resulting input-specific parameter distributions are class-aware and predominantly unimodal, providing reliable guidance for decoding.

Abstract: Modeling long-range dependencies in time series generation poses a fundamental trade-off between representational capacity and computational efficiency. Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit. Crucially, PaCoDi exploits the Hermitian Symmetry of real-valued signals to compress the sequence length by half, achieving a 50% reduction in attention FLOPs without information loss. We further derive a rigorous Heteroscedastic Loss to handle the non-isotropic noise distribution on the compressed manifold. Extensive experiments show that PaCoDi outperforms existing baselines in both generation quality and inference speed, offering a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient solution for time series modeling.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分布鲁棒的元学习框架，为ICL在Wasserstein分布偏移下的最坏情况性能提供理论保证，通过分析线性自注意力Transformer，揭示了模型鲁棒性与容量平方根的关系以及对抗性设置的样本复杂度惩罚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对ICL的理论解释假设测试任务与预训练阶段看到的分布相似，忽略了威胁现实世界可靠性的对抗性分布偏移，因此需要建立一个理论框架来分析ICL在对抗性分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于Wasserstein距离的分布鲁棒元学习框架，针对线性自注意力Transformer进行理论分析，推导出对抗性扰动强度(ρ)、模型容量(m)和上下文示例数量(N)之间的非渐近边界。

Result: 分析发现模型鲁棒性随其容量的平方根缩放(ρ_max ∝ sqrt(m))，而对抗性设置施加的样本复杂度惩罚与扰动幅度的平方成比例(N_ρ - N_0 ∝ ρ^2)。合成任务实验验证了这些缩放规律。

Conclusion: 模型容量是分布鲁棒性的基本资源，这些发现推进了对抗条件下ICL极限的理论理解，为构建更可靠的ICL系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates. Current theoretical explanations for this capability assume test tasks are drawn from a distribution similar to that seen during pretraining. This assumption overlooks adversarial distribution shifts that threaten real-world reliability. To address this gap, we introduce a distributionally robust meta-learning framework that provides worst-case performance guarantees for ICL under Wasserstein-based distribution shifts. Focusing on linear self-attention Transformers, we derive a non-asymptotic bound linking adversarial perturbation strength ($ρ$), model capacity ($m$), and the number of in-context examples ($N$). The analysis reveals that model robustness scales with the square root of its capacity ($ρ_{\text{max}} \propto \sqrt{m}$), while adversarial settings impose a sample complexity penalty proportional to the square of the perturbation magnitude ($N_ρ- N_0 \propto ρ^2$). Experiments on synthetic tasks confirm these scaling laws. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of ICL's limits under adversarial conditions and suggest that model capacity serves as a fundamental resource for distributional robustness.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss poses a significant threat to humanity, making wildlife monitoring essential for assessing ecosystem health. Avian species are ideal subjects for this due to their popularity and the ease of identifying them through their distinctive songs. Traditionalavian monitoring methods require manual counting and are therefore costly and inefficient. In passive acoustic monitoring, soundscapes are recorded over long periods of time. The recordings are analyzed to identify bird species afterwards. Machine learning methods have greatly expedited this process in a wide range of species and environments, however, existing solutions require complex models and substantial computational resources. Instead, we propose running machine learning models on inexpensive microcontroller units (MCUs) directly in the field. Due to the resulting hardware and energy constraints, efficient artificial intelligence (AI) architecture is required. In this paper, we present our method for avian monitoring on MCUs. We trained and compressed models for various numbers of target classes to assess the detection of multiple bird species on edge devices and evaluate the influence of the number of species on the compressibility of neural networks. Our results demonstrate significant compression rates with minimal performance loss. We also provide benchmarking results for different hardware platforms and evaluate the feasibility of deploying energy-autonomous devices.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a critical task across many domains, from engineering to economics, where accurate predictions drive strategic decisions. However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data. These findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of GAN-based data augmentation in enhancing financial predictive capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-turn interaction length is a dominant factor in the operational costs of conversational LLMs. In this work, we present a new failure mode in conversational LLMs: turn amplification, in which a model consistently prolongs multi-turn interactions without completing the underlying task. We show that an adversary can systematically exploit clarification-seeking behavior$-$commonly encouraged in multi-turn conversation settings$-$to scalably prolong interactions. Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts. Across multiple instruction-tuned LLMs and benchmarks, our attack substantially increases turn count while remaining compliant. We also show that existing defenses offer limited protection against this emerging class of failures.

Abstract: Developing foundation models for time series classification is of high practical relevance, as such models can serve as universal feature extractors for diverse downstream tasks. Although early models such as Mantis have shown the promise of this approach, a substantial performance gap remained between frozen and fine-tuned encoders. In this work, we introduce methods that significantly strengthen zero-shot feature extraction for time series. First, we introduce Mantis+, a variant of Mantis pre-trained entirely on synthetic time series. Second, through controlled ablation studies, we refine the architecture and obtain MantisV2, an improved and more lightweight encoder. Third, we propose an enhanced test-time methodology that leverages intermediate-layer representations and refines output-token aggregation. In addition, we show that performance can be further improved via self-ensembling and cross-model embedding fusion. Extensive experiments on UCR, UEA, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benchmarks, and EEG datasets show that MantisV2 and Mantis+ consistently outperform prior time series foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used for topology optimization (TO). However, most existing ML-based approaches focus on simplified benchmark problems due to their high computational cost, spectral bias, and difficulty in handling complex physics. These limitations become more pronounced in multi-material, multi-physics problems whose objective or constraint functions are not self-adjoint. To address these challenges, we propose a framework based on physics-informed Gaussian processes (PIGPs). In our approach, the primary, adjoint, and design variables are represented by independent GP priors whose mean functions are parametrized via neural networks whose architectures are particularly beneficial for surrogate modeling of PDE solutions. We estimate all parameters of our model simultaneously by minimizing a loss that is based on the objective function, multi-physics potential energy functionals, and design-constraints. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework on benchmark TO problems such as compliance minimization, heat conduction optimization, and compliant mechanism design under single- and multi-material settings. Additionally, we leverage thermo-mechanical TO with single- and multi-material options as a representative multi-physics problem. We also introduce differentiation and integration schemes that dramatically accelerate the training process. Our results demonstrate that the proposed PIGP framework can effectively solve coupled multi-physics and design problems simultaneously -- generating super-resolution topologies with sharp interfaces and physically interpretable material distributions. We validate these results using open-source codes and the commercial software package COMSOL.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly transformed medical prognostics by enabling rapid and accurate analysis across imaging and pathology. However, the investigation of machine learning predictions applied to prospectively collected, standardized data from observational clinical intervention trials remains underexplored, despite its potential to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy. Moreover, on a held-out set of 30 cases spanning mixed difficulty, our model achieved 80% accuracy, exceeding the average prediction accuracy of expert clinicians (75.6%), demonstrating its potential to augment clinical decision-making and support personalized CRS care.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models rely on learned routers to assign tokens to experts, yet standard softmax gating provides no principled mechanism to control the tradeoff between sparsity and utilization. We propose Grassmannian MoE (GrMoE), a routing framework that operates on the Grassmannian manifold of subspaces, where gating weights arise from the concentration parameters of Matrix Bingham distributions. This construction yields a single, interpretable knob -- the concentration matrix $Λ$ -- that continuously controls routing entropy, replacing discrete top-$k$ selection with a smooth, geometrically principled sparsity mechanism. We further develop an amortized variational inference procedure for posterior routing distributions, enabling uncertainty-aware expert assignment that naturally resists expert collapse. We formally prove tight bounds relating the Bingham concentration spectrum to routing entropy, expected top-$k$ mass, and an exponential bound on expert collapse, establishing the first formal theory of concentration-controlled sparsity. On synthetic routing tasks, a 350M-parameter MoE language model with 8 experts, a 1.3B-parameter model with 16 experts, and a 2.7B-parameter model with 32 experts, GrMoE achieves 0\% routing collapse across all seeds, comparable or better perplexity with 15--30\% improved load balance, and a smooth monotonic relationship between concentration and effective sparsity that enables post-hoc sparsity tuning without retraining. Token-level analysis reveals that experts learn heterogeneous concentration values that correlate with linguistic specialization, providing interpretable routing behavior.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from high sample complexity in sparse or delayed reward settings due to limited prior structure. Large language models (LLMs) can provide subgoal decompositions, plausible trajectories, and abstract priors that facilitate early learning. However, heavy reliance on LLM supervision introduces scalability constraints and dependence on potentially unreliable signals. We propose MIRA (Memory-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Agent), which incorporates a structured, evolving memory graph to guide early training. The graph stores decision-relevant information, including trajectory segments and subgoal structures, and is constructed from both the agent's high-return experiences and LLM outputs. This design amortizes LLM queries into a persistent memory rather than requiring continuous real-time supervision. From this memory graph, we derive a utility signal that softly adjusts advantage estimation to influence policy updates without modifying the underlying reward function. As training progresses, the agent's policy gradually surpasses the initial LLM-derived priors, and the utility term decays, preserving standard convergence guarantees. We provide theoretical analysis showing that utility-based shaping improves early-stage learning in sparse-reward environments. Empirically, MIRA outperforms RL baselines and achieves returns comparable to approaches that rely on frequent LLM supervision, while requiring substantially fewer online LLM queries.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA enable practical adaptation of large language models but provide no principled uncertainty estimates, leading to poorly calibrated predictions and unreliable behavior under domain shift. We introduce Stiefel-Bayes Adapters (SBA), a Bayesian PEFT framework that places a Matrix Langevin prior over orthonormal adapter factors on the Stiefel manifold $\St$ and performs approximate posterior inference via tangent space Laplace approximation with geodesic retraction. Unlike Gaussian priors in flat space projected onto orthogonality constraints, our prior on the manifold naturally encodes the inductive bias that adapter subspaces should be well conditioned and orthogonal, while the posterior provides calibrated predictive uncertainty without recalibration. We prove formally that the tangent space approximation strictly avoids the structural variance inflation inherent in projecting from ambient space, establishing a rigorous theoretical advantage for intrinsic manifold inference. Across GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks on RoBERTa-large, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-13B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B, domain shift evaluations, selective prediction protocols, and an abstractive summarization task, SBA achieves task performance comparable to LoRA and DoRA while reducing Expected Calibration Error by 18 to 34\% over deterministic baselines, improving selective prediction AUROC by 12 to 25\% under domain shift, and outperforming deep ensembles of five LoRA models on OOD detection at a fraction of the parameter cost. Our results demonstrate that where you place uncertainty, on the right geometric structure, matters more than simply adding any Bayesian treatment to adapters.

Abstract: In environments with sparse or delayed rewards, reinforcement learning (RL) incurs high sample complexity due to the large number of interactions needed for learning. This limitation has motivated the use of large language models (LLMs) for subgoal discovery and trajectory guidance. While LLMs can support exploration, frequent reliance on LLM calls raises concerns about scalability and reliability. We address these challenges by constructing a memory graph that encodes subgoals and trajectories from both LLM guidance and the agent's own successful rollouts. From this graph, we derive a utility function that evaluates how closely the agent's trajectories align with prior successful strategies. This utility shapes the advantage function, providing the critic with additional guidance without altering the reward. Our method relies primarily on offline input and only occasional online queries, avoiding dependence on continuous LLM supervision. Preliminary experiments in benchmark environments show improved sample efficiency and faster early learning compared to baseline RL methods, with final returns comparable to methods that require frequent LLM interaction.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a flexible family of amortized samplers trained to generate discrete and compositional objects with probability proportional to a reward function. However, learning efficiency is constrained by the model's ability to rapidly explore diverse high-probability regions during training. To mitigate this issue, recent works have focused on incentivizing the exploration of unvisited and valuable states via curiosity-driven search and self-supervised random network distillation, which tend to waste samples on already well-approximated regions of the state space. In this context, we propose Adaptive Complementary Exploration (ACE), a principled algorithm for the effective exploration of novel and high-probability regions when learning GFlowNets. To achieve this, ACE introduces an exploration GFlowNet explicitly trained to search for high-reward states in regions underexplored by the canonical GFlowNet, which learns to sample from the target distribution. Through extensive experiments, we show that ACE significantly improves upon prior work in terms of approximation accuracy to the target distribution and discovery rate of diverse high-reward states.

Abstract: Graph data often contain noisy and spurious correlations that mask the true causal relationships, which are essential for enabling graph models to make predictions based on the underlying causal structure of the data. Dependence on spurious connections makes it challenging for traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize effectively across different graphs. Furthermore, traditional aggregation methods tend to amplify these spurious patterns, limiting model robustness under distribution shifts. To address these issues, we propose Causal Neighbourhood Learning with Graph Neural Networks (CNL-GNN), a novel framework that performs causal interventions on graph structure. CNL-GNN effectively identifies and preserves causally relevant connections and reduces spurious influences through the generation of counterfactual neighbourhoods and adaptive edge perturbation guided by learnable importance masking and an attention-based mechanism. In addition, by combining structural-level interventions with the disentanglement of causal features from confounding factors, the model learns invariant node representations that are robust and generalize well across different graph structures. Our approach improves causal graph learning beyond traditional feature-based methods, resulting in a robust classification model. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets, including multiple domain variants of one dataset, demonstrate that CNL-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models.

Abstract: Inferring causal relations in timeseries data with delayed effects is a fundamental challenge, especially when the underlying system exhibits complex dynamics that cannot be captured by simple functional mappings. Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.

Abstract: Graph data is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing demand for relational insights in AI across various domains. Organizations regularly use graph data to solve complex problems involving relationships and connections. Causal learning is especially important in this context, since it helps to understand cause-effect relationships rather than mere associations. Since many real-world systems are inherently causal, graphs can efficiently model these systems. However, traditional graph machine learning methods including graph neural networks (GNNs), rely on correlations and are sensitive to spurious patterns and distribution changes. On the other hand, causal models enable robust predictions by isolating true causal factors, thus making them more stable under such shifts. Causal learning also helps in identifying and adjusting for confounders, ensuring that predictions reflect true causal relationships and remain accurate even under interventions. To address these challenges and build models that are robust and causally informed, we propose CCAGNN, a Confounder-Aware causal GNN framework that incorporates causal reasoning into graph learning, supporting counterfactual reasoning and providing reliable predictions in real-world settings. Comprehensive experiments on six publicly available datasets from diverse domains show that CCAGNN consistently outperforms leading state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Stochastic Optimal Control provides a unified mathematical framework for solving complex decision-making problems, encompassing paradigms such as maximum entropy reinforcement learning(RL) and imitation learning(IL). However, conventional parametric policies often struggle to represent the multi-modality of the solutions. Though diffusion-based policies are aimed at recovering the multi-modality, they lack an explicit probability density, which complicates policy-gradient optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose MePoly, a novel policy parameterization based on polynomial energy-based models. MePoly provides an explicit, tractable probability density, enabling exact entropy maximization. Theoretically, we ground our method in the classical moment problem, leveraging the universal approximation capabilities for arbitrary distributions. Empirically, we demonstrate that MePoly effectively captures complex non-convex manifolds and outperforms baselines in performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: In active sequential testing, also termed pure exploration, a learner is tasked with the goal to adaptively acquire information so as to identify an unknown ground-truth hypothesis with as few queries as possible. This problem, originally studied by Chernoff in 1959, has several applications: classical formulations include Best-Arm Identification (BAI) in bandits, where actions index hypotheses, and generalized search problems, where strategically chosen queries reveal partial information about a hidden label. In many modern settings, however, the hypothesis space is continuous and naturally coincides with the query/action space: for example, identifying an optimal action in a continuous-armed bandit, localizing an $ε$-ball contained in a target region, or estimating the minimizer of an unknown function from a sequence of observations. In this work, we study pure exploration in such continuous spaces and introduce Continuous In-Context Pure Exploration for this regime. We introduce C-ICPE-TS, an algorithm that meta-trains deep neural policies to map observation histories to (i) the next continuous query action and (ii) a predicted hypothesis, thereby learning transferable sequential testing strategies directly from data. At inference time, C-ICPE-TS actively gathers evidence on previously unseen tasks and infers the true hypothesis without parameter updates or explicit hand-crafted information models. We validate C-ICPE-TS across a range of benchmarks, spanning continuous best-arm identification, region localization, and function minimizer identification.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies critically on selecting training data that most benefits a model's downstream performance. Gradient-based data selection methods such as TracIn and Influence Functions leverage influence to identify useful samples, but their computational cost scales poorly, making them impractical for multi-billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). A common alternative is to use off-the-shelf smaller models as proxies, but they remain suboptimal since their learning dynamics are unclear, their sizes cannot be flexibly adjusted, and they cannot be further aligned with the target model in terms of gradient-based influence estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce Iprox, a two-stage framework that derives influence-preserving proxies directly from the target model. It first applies a low-rank compression stage to preserve influence information of the target model, and then an aligning stage to align both model gradients and logits, thereby constructing proxies that flexibly control computational cost while retaining the target model's influence. Experimental results across diverse LLM families and evaluation tasks show that Iprox consistently outperforms off-the-shelf proxies and baseline methods. On Qwen3-4B, a 1.5B proxy constructed with Iprox achieves stronger performance than the larger 1.7B off-the-shelf proxy. Notably, on Llama3.2, Iprox achieves better performance than baselines while reducing computational cost by more than half relative to the full 3B model. These results show that Iprox provides effective influence-preserving proxies, making gradient-based data selection more scalable for LLMs.

Abstract: The paradigm of decision-making has been revolutionised by reinforcement learning and deep learning. Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods. Through evaluation on reinforcement learning benchmarks and synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of the methods developed in this thesis in real-world decision making.

Abstract: Diffusion models generate high-quality samples but can also memorize training data, raising serious privacy concerns. Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.

Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on parallelization and collective operations, which are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using e.g., Huffman codes can alleviate the issue, however, Huffman codes suffer from slow, bit-sequential decoding and high hardware complexity due to deep tree traversals. Universal codes e.g., Exponential-Golomb codes are faster to decode but do not exploit the symbol frequency distributions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Dual Length Codes, a hybrid approach designed to balance compression efficiency with decoding speed. Analyzing BFloat16 tensors from the Gemma model, we observed that the top 8 most frequent symbols account for approximately 50% of the cumulative probability. These 8 symbols are assigned a short 4 bit code. The remaining 248 symbols are assigned a longer 9 bit code. The coding scheme uses a single prefix bit to distinguish between the two code lengths. The scheme uses a small Look Up Table with only 8 entries for encoding and decoding. The scheme achieves a compressibility of 18.6% in comparison to 21.3% achieved by Huffman codes, but it significantly speeds up the decoding and simplifies the hardware complexity.

Abstract: Real physical systems are dissipative -- a pendulum slows, a circuit loses charge to heat -- and forecasting their dynamics from partial observations is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. We address the \emph{position-only} (q-only) problem: given only generalized positions~$q_t$ at discrete times (momenta~$p_t$ latent), learn a structured model that (a)~produces stable long-horizon forecasts and (b)~recovers physically meaningful parameters when sufficient structure is provided. The port-Hamiltonian framework makes the conservative-dissipative split explicit via $\dot{x}=(J-R)\nabla H(x)$, guaranteeing $dH/dt\le 0$ when $R\succeq 0$. We introduce \textbf{PHAST} (Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics), which decomposes the Hamiltonian into potential~$V(q)$, mass~$M(q)$, and damping~$D(q)$ across three knowledge regimes (KNOWN, PARTIAL, UNKNOWN), uses efficient low-rank PSD/SPD parameterizations, and advances dynamics with Strang splitting. Across thirteen q-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors. We show that identification is fundamentally ill-posed without such anchors (gauge freedom), motivating a two-axis evaluation that separates forecasting stability from identifiability.

Abstract: Class imbalance induces systematic bias in deep neural networks by imposing a skewed effective class prior. This work introduces the Neural Prior Estimator (NPE), a framework that learns feature-conditioned log-prior estimates from latent representations. NPE employs one or more Prior Estimation Modules trained jointly with the backbone via a one-way logistic loss. Under the Neural Collapse regime, NPE is analytically shown to recover the class log-prior up to an additive constant, providing a theoretically grounded adaptive signal without requiring explicit class counts or distribution-specific hyperparameters. The learned estimate is incorporated into logit adjustment, forming NPE-LA, a principled mechanism for bias-aware prediction. Experiments on long-tailed CIFAR and imbalanced semantic segmentation benchmarks (STARE, ADE20K) demonstrate consistent improvements, particularly for underrepresented classes. NPE thus offers a lightweight and theoretically justified approach to learned prior estimation and imbalance-aware prediction.

Abstract: Mechanistic models encode scientific knowledge about dynamical systems and are widely used in downstream scientific and policy applications. Recent work has explored LLM-based agentic frameworks to automatically construct mechanistic models from data; however, existing problem settings substantially oversimplify real-world conditions, leaving it unclear whether LLM-generated mechanistic models are reliable in practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Modeling (NIMM) evaluation framework, which evaluates LLM-generated mechanistic models under realistic settings with partial observations and diversified task objectives. Our evaluation reveals fundamental challenges in current baselines, ranging from model effectiveness to code-level correctness. Motivated by these findings, we design NIMMgen, an agentic framework for neural-integrated mechanistic modeling that enhances code correctness and practical validity through iterative refinement. Experiments across three datasets from diversified scientific domains demonstrate its strong performance. We also show that the learned mechanistic models support counterfactual intervention simulation.

Abstract: The dataset distributions in offline reinforcement learning (RL) often exhibit complex and multi-modal distributions, necessitating expressive policies to capture such distributions beyond widely-used Gaussian policies. To handle such complex and multi-modal datasets, in this paper, we propose Flow Actor-Critic, a new actor-critic method for offline RL, based on recent flow policies. The proposed method not only uses the flow model for actor as in previous flow policies but also exploits the expressive flow model for conservative critic acquisition to prevent Q-value explosion in out-of-data regions. To this end, we propose a new form of critic regularizer based on the flow behavior proxy model obtained as a byproduct of flow-based actor design. Leveraging the flow model in this joint way, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance for test datasets of offline RL including the D4RL and recent OGBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are two key steps in the post-training of modern Language Models (LMs). A common problem is reward hacking, where the policy may exploit inaccuracies of the reward and learn an unintended behavior. Most previous works address this by limiting the policy update with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty towards a reference model. We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.

Abstract: Understanding what features are encoded by learned directions in LLM activation space requires identifying inputs that strongly activate them. Feature visualization, which optimizes inputs to maximally activate a target direction, offers an alternative to costly dataset search approaches, but remains underexplored for LLMs due to the discrete nature of text. Furthermore, existing prompt optimization techniques are poorly suited to this domain, which is highly prone to local minima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADAPT, a hybrid method combining beam search initialization with adaptive gradient-guided mutation, designed around these failure modes. We evaluate on Sparse Autoencoder latents from Gemma 2 2B, proposing metrics grounded in dataset activation statistics to enable rigorous comparison, and show that ADAPT consistently outperforms prior methods across layers and latent types. Our results establish that feature visualization for LLMs is tractable, but requires design assumptions tailored to the domain.

Abstract: Compressing neural networks without retraining is vital for deployment at scale. We study calibration-free compression through the lens of projection geometry: structured pruning is an axis-aligned projection, whereas model folding performs a low-rank projection via weight clustering. We formalize both as orthogonal operators and show that, within a rank distance of one, folding provably yields smaller parameter reconstruction error, and under mild smoothness assumptions, smaller functional perturbations than pruning. At scale, we evaluate >1000 checkpoints spanning ResNet18, PreActResNet18, ViT-B/32, and CLIP ViT-B/32 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, covering diverse training hyperparameters (optimizers, learning rates, augmentations, regularization, sharpness-aware training), as well as multiple LLaMA-family 60M and 130M parameter models trained on C4. We show that folding typically achieves higher post-compression accuracy, with the largest gains at moderate-high compression. The gap narrows and occasionally reverses at specific training setups. Our results position folding as a geometry-aware, calibration-free alternative to pruning that is often superior in practice and principled in theory.

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, motivating their adoption as expressive policies in reinforcement learning (RL). While they have shown strong performance in offline RL, particularly where the target distribution is well defined, their extension to online fine-tuning has largely been treated as a direct continuation of offline pre-training, leaving key challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO), a novel method that leverages flow matching-based policies to enhance sample efficiency for offline-to-online RL. FINO facilitates effective exploration by injecting noise into policy training, thereby encouraging a broader range of actions beyond those observed in the offline dataset. In addition to exploration-enhanced flow policy training, we combine an entropy-guided sampling mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, allowing the policy to adapt its behavior throughout online fine-tuning. Experiments across diverse, challenging tasks demonstrate that FINO consistently achieves superior performance under limited online budgets.

Abstract: AI evaluation has primarily focused on measuring capabilities, with formal approaches inspired from Item Response Theory (IRT) being increasingly applied. Yet propensities - the tendencies of models to exhibit particular behaviours - play a central role in determining both performance and safety outcomes. However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an "ideal band". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately. More broadly, our framework showcases how rigorous propensity measurements can be conducted and how it yields gains over solely using capability evaluations to predict AI behaviour.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) alters brain electrophysiology and disrupts multichannel EEG dynamics, making accurate and clinically useful EEG-based diagnosis increasingly important for screening and disease monitoring. However, many existing approaches rely on black-box classifiers and do not explicitly model the underlying dynamics that generate observed signals. To address these limitations, we propose LERD, an end-to-end Bayesian electrophysiological neural dynamical system that infers latent neural events and their relational structure directly from multichannel EEG without event or interaction annotations. LERD combines a continuous-time event inference module with a stochastic event-generation process to capture flexible temporal patterns, while incorporating an electrophysiology-inspired dynamical prior to guide learning in a principled way. We further provide theoretical analysis that yields a tractable bound for training and stability guarantees for the inferred relational dynamics. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and two real-world AD EEG cohorts demonstrate that LERD consistently outperforms strong baselines and yields physiology-aligned latent summaries that help characterize group-level dynamical differences.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Attention-based regression models are often trained by jointly optimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) loss, emphasizing the magnitude of errors and the order or shape of targets, respectively. A common but poorly understood phenomenon during training is the PCC plateau: PCC stops improving early in training, even as MSE continues to decrease. We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull. Across diverse benchmarks, including challenging homogeneous data setting, ECA consistently breaks the PCC plateau, achieving significant improvements in correlation without compromising MSE performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in multi-agent negotiation tasks, yet evaluation in this domain remains challenging due to a lack of robust and generalizable benchmarks. Abdelnabi et al. (2024) introduce a negotiation benchmark based on Scoreable Games, with the aim of developing a highly complex and realistic evaluation framework for LLMs. Our work investigates the reproducibility of claims in their benchmark, and provides a deeper understanding of its usability and generalizability. We replicate the original experiments on additional models, and introduce additional metrics to verify negotiation quality and evenness of evaluation. Our findings reveal that while the benchmark is indeed complex, model comparison is ambiguous, raising questions about its objectivity. Furthermore, we identify limitations in the experimental setup, particularly in information leakage detection and thoroughness of the ablation study. By examining and analyzing the behavior of a wider range of models on an extended version of the benchmark, we reveal insights that provide additional context to potential users. Our results highlight the importance of context in model-comparative evaluations.

Abstract: We study a sequential prediction problem in which an adversary is allowed to inject arbitrarily many adversarial instances in a stream of i.i.d.\ instances, but at each round, the learner may also \emph{abstain} from making a prediction without incurring any penalty if the instance was indeed corrupted. This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $μ$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $μ$ is \emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.

Abstract: Decoding sits between a language model and everything we do with it, yet it is still treated as a heuristic knob-tuning exercise. We argue decoding should be understood as a principled optimisation layer: at each token, we solve a regularised problem over the probability simplex that trades off model score against structural preferences and constraints. This single template recovers greedy decoding, Softmax sampling, Top-K, Top-P, and Sparsemax-style sparsity as special cases, and explains their common structure through optimality conditions. More importantly, the framework makes it easy to invent new decoders without folklore. We demonstrate this by designing Best-of-K (BoK), a KL-anchored coverage objective aimed at multi-sample pipelines (self-consistency, reranking, verifier selection). BoK targets the probability of covering good alternatives within a fixed K-sample budget and improves empirical performance. We show that such samples can improve accuracy by, for example, +18.6% for Qwen2.5-Math-7B on MATH500 at high sampling temperatures.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitors are LLM-based systems that analyze reasoning traces to detect when outputs may exhibit attributes of interest, such as test-hacking behavior during code generation. In this paper, we use information-theoretic analysis to show that non-zero mutual information between CoT and output is a necessary but not sufficient condition for CoT monitorability. We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs. Across multiple different environments, we show both methods significantly improve monitor accuracy while preventing CoT degeneration even when training against a monitor, thereby mitigating reward hacking when the task reward is imperfectly specified.

While these innovations yield significant performance gains, they compromise the identity mapping property of residual connections, leading to training instability, limited scalability, and increased memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning. By constraining the mixer M on operator-norm-bounded manifolds (e.g., bistochastic, Stiefel, Grassmann), JPmHC prevents gradient pathologies and enhances stability. JPmHC introduces three key contributions: (i) a free-probability analysis that predicts Jacobian spectra for structured skips, providing actionable design rules for mixer selection; (ii) memory-efficient implicit differentiation for fixed-point projections, reducing activation memory and synchronization overhead; and (iii) a Stiefel-constrained mixer via Cayley transforms, ensuring orthogonality without post-hoc normalization. Empirical evaluations on ARC-AGI demonstrate that JPmHC achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower computational cost compared to bistochastic baselines. As a flexible and scalable extension of HC, JPmHC advances spectrum-aware, stable, and efficient deep learning, offering insights into topological architecture design and foundational model evolution.

Abstract: We study an algorithm-independent, worst-case lower bound for the Gaussian process (GP) bandit problem in the frequentist setting, where the reward function is fixed and has a bounded norm in the known reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Specifically, we focus on the squared exponential (SE) kernel, one of the most widely used kernel functions in GP bandits. One of the remaining open questions for this problem is the gap in the \emph{dimension-dependent} logarithmic factors between upper and lower bounds. This paper partially resolves this open question under a hyperspherical input domain. We show that any algorithm suffers $Ω(\sqrt{T (\ln T)^{d} (\ln \ln T)^{-d}})$ cumulative regret, where $T$ and $d$ represent the total number of steps and the dimension of the hyperspherical domain, respectively. Regarding the simple regret, we show that any algorithm requires $Ω(ε^{-2}(\ln \frac{1}ε)^d (\ln \ln \frac{1}ε)^{-d})$ time steps to find an $ε$-optimal point. We also provide the improved $O((\ln T)^{d+1}(\ln \ln T)^{-d})$ upper bound on the maximum information gain for the SE kernel. Our results guarantee the optimality of the existing best algorithm up to \emph{dimension-independent} logarithmic factors under a hyperspherical input domain.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, clients tend to have non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, which often leads to client-drift, and therefore diminishing convergence speed and model performance. While adaptive optimizers have been proposed to mitigate these effects, they frequently introduce computational complexity or communication overhead unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT environments. This paper introduces Federated Zero Mean Gradients (FedZMG), a novel, parameter-free, client-side optimization algorithm designed to tackle client-drift by structurally regularizing the optimization space. Advancing the idea of Gradient Centralization, FedZMG projects local gradients onto a zero-mean hyperplane, effectively neutralizing the "intensity" or "bias" shifts inherent in heterogeneous data distributions without requiring additional communication or hyperparameter tuning. A theoretical analysis is provided, proving that FedZMG reduces the effective gradient variance and guarantees tighter convergence bounds compared to standard FedAvg. Extensive empirical evaluations on EMNIST, CIFAR100, and Shakespeare datasets demonstrate that FedZMG achieves better convergence speed and final validation accuracy compared to the baseline FedAvg and the adaptive optimizer FedAdam, particularly in highly non-IID settings.

Abstract: Biological neural networks (like the hippocampus) can internally generate "replay" resembling stimulus-driven activity. Recent computational models of replay use noisy recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to path-integrate. Replay in these networks has been described as Langevin sampling, but new modifiers of noisy RNN replay have surpassed this description. We re-examine noisy RNN replay as sampling to understand or improve it in three ways: (1) Under simple assumptions, we prove that the gradients replay activity should follow are time-varying and difficult to estimate, but readily motivate the use of hidden state leakage in RNNs for replay. (2) We confirm that hidden state adaptation (negative feedback) encourages exploration in replay, but show that it incurs non-Markov sampling that also slows replay. (3) We propose the first model of temporally compressed replay in noisy path-integrating RNNs through hidden state momentum, connect it to underdamped Langevin sampling, and show that, together with adaptation, it counters slowness while maintaining exploration. We verify our findings via path-integration of 2D triangular and T-maze paths and of high-dimensional paths of synthetic rat place cell activity.

Abstract: Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization (HPO) have emerged recently, leveraging bilevel programming techniques to optimize hyperparameter by estimating hypergradient w.r.t. validation loss. Nevertheless, previous theoretical works mainly focus on reducing the gap between the estimation and ground-truth (i.e., the bias), while ignoring the error due to data distribution (i.e., the variance), which degrades performance. To address this issue, we conduct a bias-variance decomposition for hypergradient estimation error and provide a supplemental detailed analysis of the variance term ignored by previous works. We also present a comprehensive analysis of the error bounds for hypergradient estimation. This facilitates an easy explanation of some phenomena commonly observed in practice, like overfitting to the validation set. Inspired by the derived theories, we propose an ensemble hypergradient strategy to reduce the variance in HPO algorithms effectively. Experimental results on tasks including regularization hyperparameter learning, data hyper-cleaning, and few-shot learning demonstrate that our variance reduction strategy improves hypergradient estimation. To explain the improved performance, we establish a connection between excess error and hypergradient estimation, offering some understanding of empirical observations.

Abstract: The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often analysed via correspondence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and fragments of first-order logic. Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.

Abstract: The trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness is a pervasive phenomenon in deep learning, yet its geometric origin remains elusive. In this work, we utilize Symmetry-Breaking Dimensional Expansion (SBDE) as a controlled probe to investigate the mechanism underlying this trade-off. SBDE expands input images by inserting constant-valued pixels, which breaks translational symmetry and consistently improves clean accuracy (e.g., from $90.47\%$ to $95.63\%$ on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18) by reducing parameter degeneracy. However, this accuracy gain comes at the cost of reduced robustness against iterative white-box attacks. By employing a test-time \emph{mask projection} that resets the inserted auxiliary pixels to their training values, we demonstrate that the vulnerability stems almost entirely from the inserted dimensions. The projection effectively neutralizes the attacks and restores robustness, revealing that the model achieves high accuracy by creating \emph{sharp boundaries} (steep loss gradients) specifically along the auxiliary axes. Our findings provide a concrete geometric explanation for the accuracy-robustness paradox: the optimization landscape deepens the basin of attraction to improve accuracy but inevitably erects steep walls along the auxiliary degrees of freedom, creating a fragile sensitivity to off-manifold perturbations.

Abstract: One-dimensional function approximation is a fundamental problem in scientific computing and engineering applications. While neural networks possess powerful universal approximation capabilities, their optimization process is often hindered by flat loss landscapes induced by parameter-space symmetries, leading to slow convergence and poor generalization, particularly for high-frequency components. Inspired by the principle of \emph{symmetry breaking} in physics, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly approach for function approximation through \emph{input-space expansion}. The core idea involves augmenting the original one-dimensional input (e.g., $x$) with constant values (e.g., $π$) to form a higher-dimensional vector (e.g., $[π, π, x, π, π]$), effectively breaking parameter symmetries without increasing the network's parameter count. We evaluate the method on ten representative one-dimensional functions, including smooth, discontinuous, high-frequency, and non-differentiable functions. Experimental results demonstrate that input-space expansion significantly accelerates training convergence (reducing LBFGS iterations by 12\% on average) and enhances approximation accuracy (reducing final MSE by 66.3\% for the optimal 5D expansion). Ablation studies further reveal the effects of different expansion dimensions and constant selections, with $π$ consistently outperforming other constants. Our work proposes a low-cost, efficient, and hardware-friendly technique for algorithm design.

Abstract: Online model selection in Bayesian bandits raises a fundamental exploration challenge: When an environment instance is sampled from a prior distribution, how can we design an adaptive strategy that explores multiple bandit learners and competes with the best one in hindsight? We address this problem by introducing a new Bayesian algorithm for online model selection in stochastic bandits. We prove an oracle-style guarantee of $O\left( d^* M \sqrt{T} + \sqrt{(MT)} \right)$ on the Bayesian regret, where $M$ is the number of base learners, $d^*$ is the regret coefficient of the optimal base learner, and $T$ is the time horizon. We also validate our method empirically across a range of stochastic bandit settings, demonstrating performance that is competitive with the best base learner. Additionally, we study the effect of sharing data among base learners and its role in mitigating prior mis-specification.

Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models often fail to be generalized across cohorts because underlying data distributions differ by clinical site, region, demographics, and measurement protocols. This limitation is particularly pronounced in hip fracture risk prediction, where the performance of models trained on one cohort (the source cohort) can degrade substantially when deployed in other cohorts (target cohorts). We used a shared set of clinical and DXA-derived features across three large cohorts - the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the UK Biobank (UKB), to systematically evaluate the performance of three domain adaptation methods - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Domain - Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and their combinations. For a source cohort with males only and a source cohort with females only, domain-adaptation methods consistently showed improved performance than the no-adaptation baseline (source-only training), and the use of combinations of multiple domain adaptation methods delivered the largest and most stable gains. The method that combines MMD, CORAL, and DANN achieved the highest discrimination with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 for a source cohort with males only and 0.95 for a source cohort with females only), demonstrating that integrating multiple domain adaptation methods could produce feature representations that are less sensitive to dataset differences. Unlike existing methods that rely heavily on supervised tuning or assume known outcomes of samples in target cohorts, our outcome-free approaches enable the model selection under realistic deployment conditions and improve generalization of models in hip fracture risk prediction.

Abstract: School congestion, where student enrollment exceeds school capacity, is a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries. It highly impacts learning outcomes and deepens inequities in education. While subsidy programs that transfer students from public to private schools offer a mechanism to alleviate congestion without capital-intensive construction, they often underperform due to fragmented data systems that hinder effective implementation. The Philippine Educational Service Contracting program, one of the world's largest educational subsidy programs, exemplifies these challenges, falling short of its goal to decongest public schools. This prevents the science-based and data-driven analyses needed to understand what shapes student enrollment flows, particularly how families respond to economic incentives and spatial constraints. We introduce a computational framework for modeling student flow patterns and simulating policy scenarios. By synthesizing heterogeneous government data across nearly 3,000 institutions, we employ a stochastic gravity model estimated via negative binomial regression to derive behavioral elasticities for distance, net tuition cost, and socioeconomic determinants. These elasticities inform a doubly constrained spatial allocation mechanism that simulates student redistribution under varying subsidy amounts while respecting both origin candidate pools and destination slot capacities. We find that geographic proximity constrains school choice four times more strongly than tuition cost and that slot capacity, not subsidy amounts, is the binding constraint. Our work demonstrates that subsidy programs alone cannot resolve systemic overcrowding, and computational modeling can empower education policymakers to make equitable, data-driven decisions by revealing the structural constraints that shape effective resource allocation, even when resources are limited.

Abstract: This work formulates and solves optimization problems to generate input points that yield high errors between a neural network's predicted AC power flow solution and solutions to the AC power flow equations. We demonstrate this capability on an instance of the CANOS-PF graph neural network model, as implemented by the PF$Δ$ benchmark library, operating on a 14-bus test grid. Generated adversarial points yield errors as large as 3.4 per-unit in reactive power and 0.08 per-unit in voltage magnitude. When minimizing the perturbation from a training point necessary to satisfy adversarial constraints, we find that the constraints can be met with as little as an 0.04 per-unit perturbation in voltage magnitude on a single bus. This work motivates the development of rigorous verification and robust training methods for neural network surrogate models of AC power flow.

Abstract: Machine learning is at the heart of managing the real-world problems associated with massive data. With the success of neural networks on such large-scale problems, more research in machine learning is being conducted now than ever before. This dissertation focuses on three different projects rooted in mathematical theory for machine learning applications.
  The first project deals with supervised learning and manifold learning. In theory, one of the main problems in supervised learning is that of function approximation: that is, given some data set $\mathcal{D}=\{(x_j,f(x_j))\}_{j=1}^M$, can one build a model $F\approx f$? We introduce a method which aims to remedy several of the theoretical shortcomings of the current paradigm for supervised learning.
  The second project deals with transfer learning, which is the study of how an approximation process or model learned on one domain can be leveraged to improve the approximation on another domain. We study such liftings of functions when the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the whole domain. We are interested in determining subsets of the target data space on which the lifting can be defined, and how the local smoothness of the function and its lifting are related.
  The third project is concerned with the classification task in machine learning, particularly in the active learning paradigm. Classification has often been treated as an approximation problem as well, but we propose an alternative approach leveraging techniques originally introduced for signal separation problems. We introduce theory to unify signal separation with classification and a new algorithm which yields competitive accuracy to other recent active learning algorithms while providing results much faster.

Abstract: Whole-brain biological neural networks naturally support the learning and control of whole-body movements. However, the use of brain connectomes as neural network controllers in embodied reinforcement learning remains unexplored. We investigate using the exact neural architecture of an adult fruit fly's brain for the control of its body movement. We develop Fly-connectomic Graph Model (FlyGM), whose static structure is identical to the complete connectome of an adult Drosophila for whole-body locomotion control. To perform dynamical control, FlyGM represents the static connectome as a directed message-passing graph to impose a biologically grounded information flow from sensory inputs to motor outputs. Integrated with a biomechanical fruit fly model, our method achieves stable control across diverse locomotion tasks without task-specific architectural tuning. To verify the structural advantages of the connectome-based model, we compare it against a degree-preserving rewired graph, a random graph, and multilayer perceptrons, showing that FlyGM yields higher sample efficiency and superior performance. This work demonstrates that static brain connectomes can be transformed to instantiate effective neural policy for embodied learning of movement control.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed stochastic gradient noise, commonly observed in transformer models, can destabilize the optimization process. Recent works mainly focus on developing and understanding approaches to address heavy-tailed noise in the centralized or distributed, synchronous setting, leaving the interactions between such noise and asynchronous optimization underexplored. In this work, we investigate two communication schemes that handle stragglers with asynchronous updates in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise. We propose and theoretically analyze algorithmic modifications based on delay-aware learning rate scheduling and delay compensation to enhance the performance of asynchronous algorithms. Our convergence guarantees under heavy-tailed noise match the rate of the synchronous counterparts and improve delay tolerance compared with existing asynchronous approaches. Empirically, our approaches outperform prior synchronous and asynchronous methods in terms of accuracy/runtime trade-offs and are more robust to hyperparameters in both image and language tasks.

Abstract: Dual-to-Dual MLLMs refer to Multimodal Large Language Models, which can enable unified multimodal comprehension and generation through text and image modalities. Although exhibiting strong instantaneous learning and generalization capabilities, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs still remain deficient in lifelong evolution, significantly affecting continual adaptation to dynamic real-world scenarios. One of the challenges is that learning new tasks inevitably destroys the learned knowledge. Beyond traditional catastrophic forgetting, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs face other challenges, including hallucination, instruction unfollowing, and failures in cross-modal knowledge transfer. However, no standardized continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs has been established yet, leaving these challenges unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we establish Continual-NExT, a continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs with deliberately-architected evaluation metrics. To improve the continual learning capability of Dual-to-Dual MLLMs, we propose an efficient MAGE (Mixture and Aggregation of General LoRA and Expert LoRA) method to further facilitate knowledge transfer across modalities and mitigate forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGE outperforms other continual learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for learning dynamical systems. These models directly encode physical principles into network architectures. However, systematic benchmarking of these approaches across diverse physical phenomena remains limited, particularly in conservative and dissipative systems. In addition, benchmarking that has been done thus far does not integrate out full trajectories to check stability. In this work, we benchmark three prominent physics-informed architectures such as Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN), Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNN), and Symplectic Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNN) using the DeepChem framework, an open-source scientific machine learning library. We evaluate these models on six dynamical systems spanning classical conservative mechanics (mass-spring system, simple pendulum, double pendulum, and three-body problem, spring-pendulum) and non-conservative systems with contact (bouncing ball). We evaluate models by computing error on predicted trajectories and evaluate error both quantitatively and qualitatively. We find that all benchmarked models struggle to maintain stability for chaotic or nonconservative systems. Our results suggest that more research is needed for physics-informed deep learning models to learn robust models of classical mechanical systems.

Abstract: Equivariance is central to graph generative models, as it ensures the model respects the permutation symmetry of graphs. However, strict equivariance can increase computational cost due to added architectural constraints, and can slow down convergence because the model must be consistent across a large space of possible node permutations. We study this trade-off for graph generative models. Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations. Experiments first show that symmetry-breaking can accelerate early training by providing an easier learning signal, but at the expense of encouraging shortcut solutions that can cause overfitting, where the model repeatedly generates graphs that are duplicates of the training set. On the contrary, properly modulating the symmetry signal can delay overfitting while accelerating convergence, allowing the model to reach stronger performance with $19\%$ of the baseline training epochs.

Abstract: Real-time schedulers must reason about tight deadlines under strict compute budgets. We present TempoNet, a reinforcement learning scheduler that pairs a permutation-invariant Transformer with a deep Q-approximation. An Urgency Tokenizer discretizes temporal slack into learnable embeddings, stabilizing value learning and capturing deadline proximity. A latency-aware sparse attention stack with blockwise top-k selection and locality-sensitive chunking enables global reasoning over unordered task sets with near-linear scaling and sub-millisecond inference. A multicore mapping layer converts contextualized Q-scores into processor assignments through masked-greedy selection or differentiable matching. Extensive evaluations on industrial mixed-criticality traces and large multiprocessor settings show consistent gains in deadline fulfillment over analytic schedulers and neural baselines, together with improved optimization stability. Diagnostics include sensitivity analyses for slack quantization, attention-driven policy interpretation, hardware-in-the-loop and kernel micro-benchmarks, and robustness under stress with simple runtime mitigations; we also report sample-efficiency benefits from behavioral-cloning pretraining and compatibility with an actor-critic variant without altering the inference pipeline. These results establish a practical framework for Transformer-based decision making in high-throughput real-time scheduling.

Abstract: We study online resource allocation under non-stationary demand with a minimum offline data requirement. In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.
  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation. Our framework advances prior work by operating with minimal offline data (one sample per period), handling arbitrary non-stationarity without variation-budget assumptions, and supporting multiple resource constraints.

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) is a biologically-inspired learning framework characterised by local, parallelisable operations, properties that enable energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. Despite this, extending PC effectively to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has been challenging, particularly for tasks involving long-range temporal dependencies. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) remains the dominant method for training RNNs, but its non-local computation, lack of spatial parallelism, and requirement to store extensive activation histories results in significant energy consumption. This work introduces a novel method combining Temporal Predictive Coding (tPC) with approximate Real-Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL), enabling effective spatio-temporal credit assignment. Results indicate that the proposed method can closely match the performance of BPTT on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks. On a challenging machine translation task, with a 15-million parameter model, the proposed method achieves a test perplexity of 7.62 (vs. 7.49 for BPTT), marking one of the first applications of tPC to tasks of this scale. These findings demonstrate the potential of this method to learn complex temporal dependencies whilst retaining the local, parallelisable, and flexible properties of the original PC framework, paving the way for more energy-efficient learning systems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to propagate information across long distances due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Existing remedies such as graph transformers or rewiring typically incur high computational cost or require altering the graph structure. We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph. This establishes the Bakry-Emery Laplacian as a principled and efficient foundation for adaptive spectral graph learning.

Abstract: Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.

Abstract: Previous work has explored the computational complexity of deriving two fundamental types of explanations for ML model predictions: (1) *sufficient reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when fixed, determine a prediction, and (2) *contrastive reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when modified, alter a prediction. Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles. In contrast, we show that even highly simplified versions of these explanations become NP-hard to compute in the corresponding local explainability setting.

Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of blast wave propagation remains a longstanding challenge due to its highly nonlinear behavior, sharp gradients, and burdensome computational cost. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer fast inference as a promising alternative, they suffer from degraded accuracy, particularly evaluated on complex urban layouts or out-of-distribution scenarios. Moreover, autoregressive prediction strategies in such models are prone to error accumulation over long forecasting horizons, limiting their robustness for extended-time simulations. To address these limitations, we propose RGD-Blast, a robust and generalizable deep surrogate model for high-fidelity, long-term blast wave forecasting. RGD-Blast incorporates a multi-scale module to capture both global flow patterns and local boundary interactions, effectively mitigating error accumulation during autoregressive prediction. We introduce a dynamic-static feature coupling mechanism that fuses time-varying pressure fields with static source and layout features, thereby enhancing out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RGD-Blast achieves a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over traditional numerical methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. In generalization tests on unseen building layouts, the model achieves an average RMSE below 0.01 and an R2 exceeding 0.89 over 280 consecutive time steps. Additional evaluations under varying blast source locations and explosive charge weights further validate its generalization, substantially advancing the state of the art in long-term blast wave modeling.

Abstract: This work presents a new approach to decentralized training-SeedFlood-designed to scale for large models across complex network topologies and achieve global consensus with minimal communication overhead. Traditional gossip-based methods suffer from message communication costs that grow with model size, while information decay over network hops renders global consensus inefficient. SeedFlood departs from these practices by exploiting the seed-reconstructible structure of zeroth-order updates and effectively making the messages near-zero in size, allowing them to be flooded to every client in the network. This mechanism makes communication overhead negligible and independent of model size, removing the primary scalability bottleneck in decentralized training. Consequently, SeedFlood enables training in regimes previously considered impractical, such as billion-parameter models distributed across hundreds of clients. Our experiments on decentralized LLM fine-tuning demonstrate thatSeedFlood consistently outperforms gossip-based baselines in both generalization performance and communication efficiency, and even achieves results comparable to first-order methods in large scale settings.

Abstract: Structured dilated attention has an appealing inference-time efficiency knob: it reduces the FLOPs of the attention and the KV cache size by a factor of the dilation size D, while preserving long-range connectivity. However, we find a persistent failure mode of them -- sparsifying a pretrained attention model to a dilated pattern leads to severe accuracy degradation. We introduce RAT+, a dense-pretraining architecture that augments attention with full-sequence recurrence and active recurrence learning. A single RAT+ model is pretrained densely once, then flexibly switched at inference time to dilated attention (optionally with local windows) or hybrid layer/head compositions, requiring only a short 1B-token resolution adaptation rather than retraining separate sparse models. At 1.5B parameters trained on 100B tokens, RAT+ closely matches dense accuracy at 16 and drops by about 2-3 points at 64 on commonsense reasoning and LongBench tasks, respectively. Moreover, RAT+ outperforms attention when sparsifying to the top-k block attention. We further scale to 2.6B parameters and 200B tokens and observe the same trend.

Abstract: Deep Generative models (DGMs) play two key roles in modern machine learning: (i) producing new information (e.g., image synthesis) and (ii) reducing dimensionality. However, traditional architectures often rely on auxiliary networks such as encoders in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or discriminators in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which introduce training instability, computational overhead, and risks like mode collapse. We present NeuroSQL, a new generative paradigm that eliminates the need for auxiliary networks by learning low-dimensional latent representations implicitly. NeuroSQL leverages an asymptotic approximation that expresses the latent variables as the solution to an optimal transportation problem. Specifically, NeuroSQL learns the latent variables by solving a linear assignment problem and then passes the latent information to a standalone generator. We benchmark its performance against GANs, VAEs, and a budget-matched diffusion baseline on four datasets: handwritten digits (MNIST), faces (CelebA), animal faces (AFHQ), and brain images (OASIS). Compared to VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models: (1) in terms of image quality, NeuroSQL achieves overall lower mean pixel distance between synthetic and authentic images and stronger perceptual/structural fidelity; (2) computationally, NeuroSQL requires the least training time; and (3) practically, NeuroSQL provides an effective solution for generating synthetic data with limited training samples. By embracing quantile assignment rather than an encoder, NeuroSQL provides a fast, stable, and robust way to generate synthetic data with minimal information loss.

Abstract: Accurate AC-PF prediction under domain shift is critical when models trained on medium-voltage (MV) grids are deployed on high-voltage (HV) networks. Existing physics-informed graph neural solvers typically rely on full fine-tuning for cross-regime transfer, incurring high retraining cost and offering limited control over the stability-plasticity trade-off between target-domain adaptation and source-domain retention. We study parameter-efficient domain adaptation for physics-informed self-attention based GNN, encouraging Kirchhoff-consistent behavior via a physics-based loss while restricting adaptation to low-rank updates. Specifically, we apply LoRA to attention projections with selective unfreezing of the prediction head to regulate adaptation capacity. This design yields a controllable efficiency-accuracy trade-off for physics-constrained inverse estimation under voltage-regime shift. Across multiple grid topologies, the proposed LoRA+PHead adaptation recovers near-full fine-tuning accuracy with a target-domain RMSE gap of $2.6\times10^{-4}$ while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 85.46%. The physics-based residual remains comparable to full fine-tuning; however, relative to Full FT, LoRA+PHead reduces MV source retention by 4.7 percentage points (17.9% vs. 22.6%) under domain shift, while still enabling parameter-efficient and physically consistent AC-PF estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness in solving PDEs, largely due to their ability to enable fast simulations once trained. However, despite the availability of high-performance computing infrastructure, many critical applications remain constrained by the substantial computational costs associated with generating large-scale, high-quality datasets and training models. In this work, inspired by studies on the structure of Green's functions for elliptic PDEs, we introduce Neural-HSS, a parameter-efficient architecture built upon the Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix structure that is provably data-efficient for a broad class of PDEs. We theoretically analyze the proposed architecture, proving that it satisfies exactness properties even in very low-data regimes. We also investigate its connections with other architectural primitives, such as the Fourier neural operator layer and convolutional layers. We experimentally validate the data efficiency of Neural-HSS on the three-dimensional Poisson equation over a grid of two million points, demonstrating its superior ability to learn from data generated by elliptic PDEs in the low-data regime while outperforming baseline methods. Finally, we demonstrate its capability to learn from data arising from a broad class of PDEs in diverse domains, including electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and biology.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a proof of concept for a variational distributional neuron: a compute unit formulated as a VAE brick, explicitly carrying a prior, an amortized posterior and a local ELBO. The unit is no longer a deterministic scalar but a distribution: computing is no longer about propagating values, but about contracting a continuous space of possibilities under constraints. Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This "contraction" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze "collapse" modes and the conditions for a "living neuron", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.

Abstract: Data-efficient neural decoding is a central challenge for speech brain-computer interfaces. We present the first demonstration of transfer learning and cross-task decoding for MEG-based speech models spanning perception and production. We pre-train a Conformer-based model on 50 hours of single-subject listening data and fine-tune on just 5 minutes per subject across 18 participants. Transfer learning yields consistent improvements, with in-task accuracy gains of 1-4% and larger cross-task gains of up to 5-6%. Not only does pre-training improve performance within each task, but it also enables reliable cross-task decoding between perception and production. Critically, models trained on speech production decode passive listening above chance, confirming that learned representations reflect shared neural processes rather than task-specific motor activity.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) generate text token-by-token, requiring n forward passes to produce a sequence of length n. Recent work, Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Reconstruction (Mezentsev and Oseledets), shows that frozen LLMs can reconstruct hundreds of tokens from only two learned proto-tokens in a single forward pass, suggesting a path beyond the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for "imposing" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable practical success of transformer-based language models, recent work has raised concerns about their ability to perform state tracking. In particular, a growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct a large-scale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with state-space size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains a fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match.

Abstract: AutoClustering methods aim to automate unsupervised learning tasks, including algorithm selection (AS), hyperparameter optimization (HPO), and pipeline synthesis (PS), by often leveraging meta-learning over dataset meta-features. While these systems often achieve strong performance, their recommendations are often difficult to justify: the influence of dataset meta-features on algorithm and hyperparameter choices is typically not exposed, limiting reliability, bias diagnostics, and efficient meta-feature engineering. This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions. Our findings highlight consistent patterns in meta-feature relevance, identify structural weaknesses in current meta-learning strategies that can distort recommendations, and provide actionable guidance for more interpretable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) design. This study therefore offers a practical foundation for increasing decision transparency in unsupervised learning automation.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of main engine power is essential for vessel performance optimization, fuel efficiency, and compliance with emission regulations. Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones. The proposed framework provides a practical and computationally efficient tool for vessel performance monitoring, with applications in weather routing, trim optimization, and energy efficiency planning.

We also report a general linear-mixing extension in tangent space, which applies across subgroup choices and improves finite-budget performance in the current O(d) experiments.

Abstract: Autonomous (noise-agnostic) generative models, such as Equilibrium Matching and blind diffusion, challenge the standard paradigm by learning a single, time-invariant vector field that operates without explicit noise-level conditioning. While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\text{marg}}(\mathbf{u}) = -\log p(\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\mathbf{u}) = \int p(\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models. Conversely, we prove that velocity-based parameterizations are inherently stable because they satisfy a bounded-gain condition that absorbs posterior uncertainty into a smooth geometric drift.

Abstract: Clustering is widely used for unsupervised structure discovery, yet it offers limited insight into how reliable each individual assignment is. Diagnostics, such as convergence behavior or objective values, may reflect global quality, but they do not indicate whether particular instances are assigned confidently, especially for initialization-sensitive algorithms like k-means. This assignment-level instability can undermine both accuracy and robustness. Ensemble approaches improve global consistency by aggregating multiple runs, but they typically lack tools for quantifying pointwise confidence in a way that combines cross-run agreement with geometric support from the learned cluster structure. We introduce CAKE (Confidence in Assignments via K-partition Ensembles), a framework that evaluates each point using two complementary statistics computed over a clustering ensemble: assignment stability and consistency of local geometric fit. These are combined into a single, interpretable score in [0,1]. Our theoretical analysis shows that CAKE remains effective under noise and separates stable from unstable points. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that CAKE effectively highlights ambiguous points and stable core members, providing a confidence ranking that can guide filtering or prioritization to improve clustering quality.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models and AI agents across critical societal and technical domains is hindered by persistent behavioral pathologies including sycophancy, hallucination, and strategic deception that resist mitigation via reinforcement learning. Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a "locked-in" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality.

Motivation: 语言模型存在幻觉、脆弱性和缺乏形式化基础等根本性缺陷，这些问题在需要可验证推理的高风险专业领域（如数学）尤为突出。作者旨在探究形式化领域本体是否能够通过检索增强生成来提高语言模型的可靠性。

Method: 1. 以数学作为验证概念的研究领域，使用OpenMath本体。2. 实现神经符号管道：结合混合检索（hybrid retrieval）和交叉编码器重排序（cross-encoder reranking），从本体中提取相关定义并注入到模型提示中。3. 在MATH基准测试上评估了三种开源语言模型。

Result: 1. 当检索质量高时，本体引导的上下文能显著提升语言模型的性能。2. 不相关或不准确的检索上下文会主动降低模型性能。3. 这突显了神经符号方法在提高语言模型可靠性方面的潜力，但也揭示了其关键挑战：检索质量至关重要。

Conclusion: 形式化领域本体在增强语言模型可靠性方面具有潜力，特别是通过高质量的检索增强生成。然而，检索的准确性是关键因素——不相关的上下文会损害性能。这为未来神经符号方法的研究指出了方向：需要更精确的检索和上下文整合机制。

Abstract: Language models exhibit fundamental limitations -- hallucination, brittleness, and lack of formal grounding -- that are particularly problematic in high-stakes specialist fields requiring verifiable reasoning. I investigate whether formal domain ontologies can enhance language model reliability through retrieval-augmented generation. Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking to inject relevant definitions into model prompts. Evaluation on the MATH benchmark with three open-source models reveals that ontology-guided context improves performance when retrieval quality is high, but irrelevant context actively degrades it -- highlighting both the promise and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models is increasingly challenging as models improve. Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other. We evaluate 10 frontier models on TTG, and closely match the ranking from existing benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam, without involving any human effort in creating puzzles. We also find that creating good puzzles is still a highly challenging task for current models, not measured by previous benchmarks. Overall, our work suggests new paradigms for evaluating reasoning that cannot be saturated by design, and that allow testing models for other skills like creativity and task creation alongside problem solving.

Abstract: Traditional AI alignment primarily focuses on individual model outputs; however, autonomous agents in long-horizon workflows require sustained reliability across entire interaction trajectories. We introduce APEMO (Affect-aware Peak-End Modulation for Orchestration), a runtime scheduling layer that optimizes computational allocation under fixed budgets by operationalizing temporal-affective signals. Instead of modifying model weights, APEMO detects trajectory instability through behavioral proxies and targets repairs at critical segments, such as peak moments and endings. Evaluation across multi-agent simulations and LLM-based planner--executor flows demonstrates that APEMO consistently enhances trajectory-level quality and reuse probability over structural orchestrators. Our results reframe alignment as a temporal control problem, offering a resilient engineering pathway for the development of long-horizon agentic systems.

TL;DR: WorkflowPerturb是一个用于评估LLM生成结构化工作流的基准测试，通过向黄金工作流施加受控扰动来测试评估指标的敏感性和校准能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的结构化工作流实际评估困难，因为指标分数通常未校准，且分数变化不能直接反映工作流退化的严重程度，需要系统研究评估指标的质量。

Method: 创建4,973个黄金工作流和44,757个扰动变体，应用三种扰动类型（缺失步骤、压缩步骤、描述变化）和三个严重级别（10%、30%、50%），分析不同指标家族的敏感性和校准特性。

Result: 研究揭示了不同指标家族之间的系统性差异，支持基于严重程度的工作流评估分数解释。

Conclusion: WorkflowPerturb基准有助于更准确地评估工作流质量，为评估LLM生成工作流的指标提供了校准和严重程度感知的分析框架。

Abstract: LLM-based systems increasingly generate structured workflows for complex tasks. In practice, automatic evaluation of these workflows is difficult, because metric scores are often not calibrated, and score changes do not directly communicate the severity of workflow degradation. We introduce WorkflowPerturb, a controlled benchmark for studying workflow evaluation metrics. It works by applying realistic, controlled perturbations to golden workflows. WorkflowPerturb contains 4,973 golden workflows and 44,757 perturbed variants across three perturbation types (Missing Steps, Compressed Steps, and Description Changes), each applied at severity levels of 10%, 30%, and 50%. We benchmark multiple metric families and analyze their sensitivity and calibration using expected score trajectories and residuals. Our results characterize systematic differences across metric families and support severity-aware interpretation of workflow evaluation scores. Our dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Scalable robot policy pre-training has been hindered by the high cost of collecting high-quality demonstrations for each platform. In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised representations are widely assumed to be neutral with respect to sensitive attributes when those attributes are withheld from training. We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines. We have made the code available at~ https://github.com/JosephBingham/SOMtime

TL;DR: 在线多智能体强化学习的一种新的扩散策略框架，显著提升样本效率和协调能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散式生成模型在图像生成和离线强化学习中展现了强大的表达能力和多模态表示能力，但在在线多智能体强化学习领域仍未被充分探索。主要的障碍是扩散模型难以处理联合熵优化，这是协调所需的关键因素。需要新的方法来克服扩散模型在在线多智能体协调中的限制。

Method: 提出了OMAD框架：1) 引入放松的策略目标来最大化缩放后的联合熵，实现有效探索而不依赖于可处理的似然值；2) 在集中训练与分散执行（CTDE）框架下，采用联合分布价值函数来优化分散的扩散策略；3) 利用可处理的熵增目标来指导扩散策略的同时更新，确保稳定的协调。

Result: 在MPE和MAMuJoCo的10个多样任务上进行广泛评估，结果显示该方法在所有任务上达到新的最先进水平，样本效率比现有方法提高了2.5到5倍。

Conclusion: OMAD框架成功将扩散策略应用于在线多智能体强化学习，无需依赖可处理的似然值即可实现有效的探索和协调，为多智能体协调问题提供了一个强大且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a prominent framework for efficient agent coordination. Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \underline{O}nline off-policy \underline{MA}RL framework using \underline{D}iffusion policies (\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination. Extensive evaluations on MPE and MAMuJoCo establish our method as the new state-of-the-art across $10$ diverse tasks, demonstrating a remarkable $2.5\times$ to $5\times$ improvement in sample efficiency.
