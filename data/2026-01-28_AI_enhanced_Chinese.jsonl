Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.", "AI": {"tldr": "IPBC is an interactive clustering framework combining user feedback and nonlinear projection to improve high-dimensional data clustering.", "motivation": "High-dimensional datasets are challenging to cluster due to diminishing distance metric usefulness and cluster overlap in lower dimensions.

Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task.

A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification", "comment": "17 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity.

Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill.

Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization.

While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction.

In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process.

Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems.

Technical report/winner report for the VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge (2025)", "summary": "Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns.

We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers.

Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV.

In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses.

Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion.

This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents.

Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise.

We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark.

To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data.

To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM).

In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results.

We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness.

To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders.

Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\\% capability retention on standard benchmarks.

We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes.

Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs.

However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation.

This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths.

We prove end-to-end grokking results for learning over-parameterized linear regression models using gradient descent with weight decay. Specifically, we prove that the following stages occur: (i) the model overfits the training data early during training; (ii) poor generalization persists long after overfitting has manifested; and (iii) the generalization error eventually becomes arbitrarily small. Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the \"grokking time\") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks. Our results suggest that grokking is not an inherent failure mode of deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions, and thus does not require fundamental changes to the model architecture or learning algorithm to avoid.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty.

While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks.

Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels.

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size.

Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting.
