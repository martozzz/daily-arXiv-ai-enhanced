However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.\n  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.\n  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.\n  Keywords: House-Tree-Person test; multimodal large language model; multi-agent collaboration; cosine similarity; computational psychology; artificial intelligence", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728HTP\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3HTP\u7ed8\u753b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u68c0\u67e5\u8005\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u91cf\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a0.75\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u7ea60.05\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.85\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u751f\u6001\u6548\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u5c04\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book \"Life and Death Dictionary\" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work.

To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training.

Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection).

Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses.

Scaling laws for pre-training define a power-law relationship between dataset size and the test loss of an LLM.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise.

Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information.

A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles.

Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost.

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller \"compressor\" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger \"predictor\" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\\times$ more accurate, $4.6\\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors.

To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings.

The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy.

Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias.

To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints.

However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows.

To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \\(\\pm\\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization.

Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Motivated by this inefficiency, we propose \\emph{Selective Adversarial Training}, which perturbs only a subset of critical samples in each minibatch. Specifically, we introduce two principled selection criteria: (1) margin-based sampling, which prioritizes samples near the decision boundary, and (2) gradient-matching sampling, which selects samples whose gradients align with the dominant batch optimization direction. Adversarial examples are generated only for the selected subset, while the remaining samples are trained cleanly using a mixed objective.

However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference.
