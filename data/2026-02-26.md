### [1] [Latent Context Compilation: Distilling Long Context into Compact Portable Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21221)
*Zeju Li,Yizhou Zhou,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Context Compilation 是一个解决长上下文 LLM 高效部署的新框架，通过“编译”而非“自适应”的长上下文处理方法，使用可丢弃的 LoRA 作为编译器，将上下文蒸馏成轻量、可移植的 Buffer Tokens，无需昂贵的合成数据，实现了状态无关性和低开销服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效处理长上下文的方法主要分两种：一种是平摊压缩（amortized compression），但该方法在分布外泛化上表现不佳；另一种是测试时训练（Test-Time Training），但会带来高昂的合成数据成本，并且需要修改模型权重，导致参数带有状态，使得并发服务变得复杂。这两种方法都阻碍了长上下文大语言模型的部署。

Method: Latent Context Compilation 在推理前启用一个临时的 LoRA 模块作为编译器，从长上下文中提炼出低维的 Buffer Tokens。这些 Token 是状态无关的，可以与任何冻结的基础模型即插即用。关键创新是一种自对齐优化策略，通过使用与上下文无关的随机查询来正则化上下文重建任务，确保压缩后的表示驻留在模型已有的指令跟随流形中，而无需生成代价高昂的上下文相关问答对。

Result: 在 Llama-3.1-8B 模型上的实验表明，Latent Context Compilation 方法在保持模型推理能力和细粒度细节方面优于现有方法。即使在高达 16 倍的压缩比下，也能有效解耦内存密度与模型参数，证明了该框架的实用性和高效性。

Conclusion: Latent Context Compilation 为解决长上下文大语言模型部署面临的挑战提供了一套可行的方案。它通过在推理期间将长上下文编译为小型、可移植的 Buffer Tokens，成功地实现了内存效率与模型性能的有效平衡，并为未来的大规模长上下文应用部署提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Efficient long-context LLM deployment is stalled by a dichotomy between amortized compression, which struggles with out-of-distribution generalization, and Test-Time Training, which incurs prohibitive synthetic data costs and requires modifying model weights, creating stateful parameters that complicate concurrent serving. We propose Latent Context Compilation, a framework that fundamentally shifts context processing from adaptation to compilation. By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold. Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that Latent Context Compilation preserves fine-grained details and reasoning capabilities where prior methods falter, effectively decoupling memory density from model parameters even at a 16x compression ratio.

Abstract: This technical report introduces AngelSlim, a comprehensive and versatile toolkit for large model compression developed by the Tencent Hunyuan team. By consolidating cutting-edge algorithms, including quantization, speculative decoding, token pruning, and distillation. AngelSlim provides a unified pipeline that streamlines the transition from model compression to industrial-scale deployment. To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model. Beyond quantization, we propose a training-aligned speculative decoding framework compatible with multimodal architectures and modern inference engines, achieving 1.8x to 2.0x throughput gains without compromising output correctness. Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning. By integrating these compression strategies from low-level implementations, AngelSlim enables algorithm-focused research and tool-assisted deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present Group Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (GOPO), a new alignment algorithm for large language models derived from the geometry of Hilbert function spaces. Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) performs computation directly within resistive crossbar arrays, offering an energy-efficient platform to scale large vision and language models. However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy. In this work, we present the first theoretical characterization of the pulse complexity of SP calibration and the resulting estimation error. We further propose a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks the SP during model training, and establishes its convergence guarantees. In addition, we develop an enhanced variant based on chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing. Numerical experiments demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Individuals with similar qualifications and skills may vary in their demeanor, or outward manner: some tend toward self-promotion while others are modest to the point of omitting crucial information. Comparing the self-descriptions of equally qualified job-seekers with different self-presentation styles is therefore problematic.
  We build an interactive AI for skill elicitation that provides accurate determination of skills while simultaneously allowing individuals to speak in their own voice. Such a system can be deployed, for example, when a new user joins a professional networking platform, or when matching employees to needs during a company reorganization. To obtain sufficient training data, we train an LLM to act as synthetic humans.
  Elicitation mitigates endogenous bias arising from individuals' own self-reports. To address systematic model bias we enforce a mathematically rigorous notion of equitability ensuring that the covariance between self-presentation manner and skill evaluation error is small.

*Teodor Vanislavov Marinov,Mehryar Mohri,Princewill Okoroafor,Jon Schneider,Julian Zimmert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个高效的机遇性可达性算法，避免了在线校准的需求，实现了O(T^{-1/4})的收敛率（非高效版本为O(T^{-1/3})），在对手动作集维度≤2时可获得最优的O(T^{-1/2})收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机遇性可达性是Blackwell可达性的一般化，学习者希望在对手限制自身动作空间子集时获得更强的保证。Bernstein等人2014年提出的算法需要在线校准预测对手动作，这通常需要指数时间且收敛率较差（T^{-O(1/d)}）。

Method: 设计了一种不需要在线校准子程序的算法，通过替代技术避免了对校准的依赖，提供了两个版本：高效算法（O(T^{-1/4})）和非高效但更快收敛的算法（O(T^{-1/3})）。特别针对低维情况（维度≤2）给出了最优收敛率的方案。

Result: 提出的算法在机遇性可达性问题上取得了显著的改进：高效算法达到O(T^{-1/4})收敛率，非高效算法达到O(T^{-1/3})，相比之下之前方法需要指数时间且只有T^{-O(1/d)}收敛率。在对手动作集维度≤2时，可以获得最优的O(T^{-1/2})收敛率。

Conclusion: 本文通过设计不需要在线校准的新算法，解决了机遇性可达性问题的效率瓶颈，显著提高了收敛速度，特别在低维情况下达到了理论最优收敛率，为机遇性可达性提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of opportunistic approachability: a generalization of Blackwell approachability where the learner would like to obtain stronger guarantees (i.e., approach a smaller set) when their adversary limits themselves to a subset of their possible action space. Bernstein et al. (2014) introduced this problem in 2014 and presented an algorithm that guarantees sublinear approachability rates for opportunistic approachability. However, this algorithm requires the ability to produce calibrated online predictions of the adversary's actions, a problem whose standard implementations require time exponential in the ambient dimension and result in approachability rates that scale as $T^{-O(1/d)}$. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for opportunistic approachability that achieves a rate of $O(T^{-1/4})$ (and an inefficient one that achieves a rate of $O(T^{-1/3})$), bypassing the need for an online calibration subroutine. Moreover, in the case where the dimension of the adversary's action set is at most two, we show it is possible to obtain the optimal rate of $O(T^{-1/2})$.

Abstract: Representation learning has been essential for graph machine learning tasks such as link prediction, community detection, and network visualization. Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model that represents networks using two levels of convex hulls. At the global level, the vertices of a convex hull are treated as archetypes, each corresponding to a pure community in the network. At the local level, each community is refined by a prototypical hull whose vertices act as representative profiles, capturing community-specific variation. This two-level construction yields clear multi-scale explanations: a node's position relative to global archetypes and its local prototypes directly accounts for its edges. The geometry is well-behaved by design, while local hulls are kept disjoint by construction. To further encourage diversity and stability, we place principled priors, including determinantal point processes, and fit the model under MAP estimation with scalable subsampling. Experiments on real networks demonstrate the ability of GraphHull to recover multi-level community structure and to achieve competitive or superior performance in link prediction and community detection, while naturally providing interpretable predictions.

Abstract: Time series causal discovery is essential for understanding dynamic systems, yet many existing methods remain sensitive to noise, non-stationarity, and sampling variability. We propose the Validated Consensus-Driven Framework (VCDF), a simple and method-agnostic layer that improves robustness by evaluating the stability of causal relations across blocked temporal subsets. VCDF requires no modification to base algorithms and can be applied to methods such as VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above. Evaluations on simulated fMRI data and IT-monitoring scenarios further demonstrate enhanced stability and structural accuracy under realistic noise conditions. VCDF provides an effective reliability layer for time series causal discovery without altering underlying modeling assumptions.

Conclusion: 本文通过连接多校准、RKHS和变分不等式，提出了第一个能够在在线环境中高效生成不可区分非伯努利结果的框架，为生成不可证伪模型提供了理论基础和实用算法。

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently producing, in an online fashion, generative models of scalar, multiclass, and vector-valued outcomes that cannot be falsified on the basis of the observed data and a pre-specified collection of computational tests. Our contributions are twofold. First, we expand on connections between online high-dimensional multicalibration with respect to an RKHS and recent advances in expected variational inequality problems, enabling efficient algorithms for the former. We then apply this algorithmic machinery to the problem of outcome indistinguishability. Our procedure, Defensive Generation, is the first to efficiently produce online outcome indistinguishable generative models of non-Bernoulli outcomes that are unfalsifiable with respect to infinite classes of tests, including those that examine higher-order moments of the generated distributions. Furthermore, our method runs in near-linear time in the number of samples and achieves the optimal, vanishing T^{-1/2} rate for generation error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 为了解决联邦学习中数据异质性导致的客户端漂移和泛化性能下降问题，提出了FedVG框架，该框架利用全局验证集（来自公共数据集）来指导优化过程，通过计算验证梯度范数评估客户端模型的泛化能力，从而实现更智能的自适应联邦聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据异质性会导致客户端漂移，从而降低模型的整体泛化性能。现有方法过度关注性能较差的客户端，加剧了这一问题的负面影响。

Method: 提出FedVG联邦聚合框架：1）使用公共数据集构建全局验证集，保持可访问性和隐私性；2）计算客户端模型在验证集上各层的梯度范数，量化客户端需要调整的程度；3）基于梯度范数得分进行自适应联邦聚合，而不是仅依赖客户端数据量。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FedVG在高度异构的环境中能持续提升性能，且可以与多种先进FL算法无缝集成，进一步提升其效果。

Conclusion: FedVG通过全局验证集指导的梯度范数评估，有效缓解了数据异质性带来的客户端漂移问题，提升了联邦学习的泛化性能，具有良好的通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing their private data. However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results. Our code is available at https://github.com/alinadevkota/FedVG.

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) surrogates are the default tool for emulating expensive computer experiments, but cubic cost, stationarity assumptions, and Gaussian predictive distributions limit their reach. We propose Generative Bayesian Computation (GBC) via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQNs) as a surrogate framework that targets all three limitations. GBC learns the full conditional quantile function from input--output pairs; at test time, a single forward pass per quantile level produces draws from the predictive distribution.
  Across fourteen benchmarks we compare GBC to four GP-based methods. GBC improves CRPS by 11--26\% on piecewise jump-process benchmarks, by 14\% on a ten-dimensional Friedman function, and scales linearly to 90,000 training points where dense-covariance GPs are infeasible. A boundary-augmented variant matches or outperforms Modular Jump GPs on two-dimensional jump datasets (up to 46\% CRPS improvement). In active learning, a randomized-prior IQN ensemble achieves nearly three times lower RMSE than deep GP active learning on Rocket LGBB. Overall, GBC records a favorable point estimate in 12 of 14 comparisons. GPs retain an edge on smooth surfaces where their smoothness prior provides effective regularization.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching models, have achieved remarkable success in learning complex data distributions. However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Selecting the right deep learning model for power grid forecasting is challenging, as performance heavily depends on the data available to the operator. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of five modern neural architectures: two state space models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba), two Transformers (iTransformer, PatchTST), and a traditional LSTM. We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price. Ultimately, this benchmark provides grid operators with actionable guidelines for selecting the optimal forecasting architecture based on their specific data environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become the leading paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework. Evaluated on MATH-500 and AIME 2025, ACE composes seamlessly with existing methods and consistently improves the full Pass@k spectrum across all three model families and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents under partial observability often condition actions on internally accumulated information such as memory or inferred latent context. We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a posterior distribution arising in Bayesian inverse problems in science, engineering, and imaging. Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators. The results show that Proximal-IMH reliably outperforms existing IMH variants.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many emerging agentic paradigms require agents to collaborate with one another (or people) to achieve shared goals. Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics for fluids increasingly relies on neural operators and Transformer-based models, yet these approaches often lack interpretability and struggle with localized, high-frequency structures while incurring quadratic cost in spatial samples. We propose representing fields with a Gaussian basis, where learned atoms carry explicit geometry (centers, anisotropic scales, weights) and form a compact, mesh-agnostic, directly visualizable state. Building on this representation, we introduce a Gaussian Particle Operator that acts in modal space: learned Gaussian modal windows perform a Petrov-Galerkin measurement, and PG Gaussian Attention enables global cross-scale coupling. This basis-to-basis design is resolution-agnostic and achieves near-linear complexity in N for a fixed modal budget, supporting irregular geometries and seamless 2D-to-3D extension. On standard PDE benchmarks and real datasets, our method attains state-of-the-art competitive accuracy while providing intrinsic interpretability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) deliver detailed responses on vision-language tasks, yet remain susceptible to object hallucination (introducing objects not present in the image), undermining reliability in practice. Prior efforts often rely on heuristic penalties, post-hoc correction, or generic decoding tweaks, which do not directly intervene in the mechanisms that trigger object hallucination and thus yield limited gains. To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality.

Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term traffic demand is critical for intelligent transportation systems. While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

Abstract: The recent field of neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) studies the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to emulate classical algorithms like Bellman-Ford, a phenomenon known as algorithmic alignment. At the same time, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spawned the study of mechanistic interpretability, which aims to identify granular model components like circuits that perform specific computations. In this work, we introduce Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (MINAR), an efficient circuit discovery toolbox that adapts attribution patching methods from mechanistic interpretability to the GNN setting. We show through two case studies that MINAR recovers faithful neuron-level circuits from GNNs trained on algorithmic tasks. Our study sheds new light on the process of circuit formation and pruning during training, as well as giving new insight into how GNNs trained to perform multiple tasks in parallel reuse circuit components for related tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/pnnl/MINAR.

Abstract: Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be interpreted as discrete-time state-space models, where the state evolution corresponds to an infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filtering operation governed by both feedforward weights and recurrent poles. While, in principle, all parameters including pole locations can be optimized via backpropagation through time (BPTT), such joint learning incurs substantial computational overhead and is often impractical for applications with limited training data. Echo state networks (ESNs) mitigate this limitation by fixing the recurrent dynamics and training only a linear readout, enabling efficient and stable online adaptation. In this work, we analytically and empirically examine why learning recurrent poles does not provide tangible benefits in data-constrained, real-time learning scenarios. Our analysis shows that pole learning renders the weight optimization problem highly non-convex, requiring significantly more training samples and iterations for gradient-based methods to converge to meaningful solutions. Empirically, we observe that for complex-valued data, gradient descent frequently exhibits prolonged plateaus, and advanced optimizers offer limited improvement. In contrast, fixed-pole architectures induce stable and well-conditioned state representations even with limited training data. Numerical results demonstrate that fixed-pole networks achieve superior performance with lower training complexity, making them more suitable for online real-time tasks.

Abstract: We propose Excitation, a novel optimization framework designed to accelerate learning in sparse architectures such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs). Unlike traditional optimizers that treat all parameters uniformly, Excitation dynamically modulates updates using batch-level expert utilization. It introduces a competitive update dynamic that amplifies updates to highly-utilized experts and can selectively suppress low-utilization ones, effectively sharpening routing specialization. Notably, we identify a phenomenon of "structural confusion" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, "rescuing" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings. Across language and vision tasks, Excitation consistently improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models, indicating that active update modulation is a key mechanism for effective conditional computation.

Abstract: We describe extensive numerical experiments assessing and quantifying how classifier performance depends on the quality of the training data, a frequently neglected component of the analysis of classifiers.
  More specifically, in the scientific context of metagenomic assembly of short DNA reads into "contigs," we examine the effects of degrading the quality of the training data by multiple mechanisms, and for four classifiers -- Bayes classifiers, neural nets, partition models and random forests. We investigate both individual behavior and congruence among the classifiers. We find breakdown-like behavior that holds for all four classifiers, as degradation increases and they move from being mostly correct to only coincidentally correct, because they are wrong in the same way. In the process, a picture of spatial heterogeneity emerges: as the training data move farther from analysis data, classifier decisions degenerate, the boundary becomes less dense, and congruence increases.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is an important domain within post-hoc explainability. However, the explanations generated by most CE generators are often highly redundant. This work introduces an open-source Python library xai-cola, which provides an end-to-end pipeline for sparsifying CEs produced by arbitrary generators, reducing superfluous feature changes while preserving their validity. It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object (for standardization and encoding), and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI. Empirical experiments indicate that xai-cola produces sparser counterfactuals across several CE generators, reducing the number of modified features by up to 50% in our setting. The source code is available at https://github.com/understanding-ml/COLA.

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective in a wide range of 3D modeling tasks. A fundamental operation of such networks is the tensor product, which allows interaction between different feature types. Because this operation scales poorly, there has been considerable work towards accelerating this interaction. However, recently \citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$. We first show how generalizing fast Fourier based convolution naturally leads to the previously proposed Gaunt tensor product \citep{gaunt}. To remedy antisymmetry issues, we generalize from scalar signals to irrep valued signals, giving us tensor spherical harmonics. We prove a generalized Gaunt formula for the tensor harmonics. Finally, we show that we only need up to vector valued signals to recover the missing interactions of Gaunt tensor product.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of shaft rotational speed, shaft power, and fuel consumption is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability in maritime transportation. Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects. These results demonstrate that PI-KAN achieves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust tool for vessel performance monitoring and decision support in operational settings.

Abstract: A key challenge in artificial intelligence and neuroscience is understanding how neural systems learn representations that capture the underlying dynamics of the world. Most world models represent the transition function with unstructured neural networks, limiting interpretability, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen states or action compositions. We address these issues with a generalizable world model grounded in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) principles as geometric priors. Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline. These results highlight how training to have latent group structure yields generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable world models, providing a principled pathway toward structured models for real-world planning and reasoning.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have achieved strong univariate forecasting through large-scale pre-training, yet effectively extending this success to multivariate forecasting remains challenging. To address this, we propose DualWeaver, a novel framework that adapts univariate TSFMs (Uni-TSFMs) for multivariate forecasting by using a pair of learnable, structurally symmetric surrogate series. Generated by a shared auxiliary feature-fusion module that captures cross-variable dependencies, these surrogates are mapped to TSFM-compatible series via the forecasting objective. The symmetric structure enables parameter-free reconstruction of final predictions directly from the surrogates, without additional parametric decoding. A theoretically grounded regularization term is further introduced to enhance robustness against adaptation collapse. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that DualWeaver outperforms state-of-the-art multivariate forecasters in both accuracy and stability. We release the code at https://github.com/li-jinpeng/DualWeaver.

Abstract: Data assimilation and scientific inverse problems require reconstructing high-dimensional physical states from sparse and noisy observations, ideally with uncertainty-aware posterior samples that remain faithful to learned priors and governing physics. While training-free conditional generation is well developed for diffusion models, corresponding conditioning and posterior sampling strategies for Flow Matching (FM) priors remain comparatively under-explored, especially on scientific benchmarks where fidelity must be assessed beyond measurement misfit. In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction. Across these settings, we quantify trade-offs among measurement assimilation, posterior diversity, and physics/statistics fidelity, and establish D-Flow SGLD as a practical FM-compatible posterior sampler for scientific inverse problems.

Abstract: Many real-world applications provide a continuous stream of data that is subsequently used by machine learning models to solve regression tasks of interest. Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/marinaAlchirch/DSFA_2026.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as strong alternatives to autoregressive language models, with recent work initializing and fine-tuning a base unimodal model for bimodal generation. Diverging from previous approaches, we introduce the first tri-modal masked diffusion model pretrained from scratch on text, image-text, and audio-text data. We systematically analyze multimodal scaling laws, modality mixing ratios, noise schedules, and batch-size effects, and we provide optimized inference sampling defaults. Our batch-size analysis yields a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based reparameterization that eliminates the need for tuning the optimal batch size as reported in recent work. This reparameterization decouples the physical batch size, often chosen based on compute constraints (GPU saturation, FLOP efficiency, wall-clock time), from the logical batch size, chosen to balance gradient variance during stochastic optimization. Finally, we pretrain a preliminary 3B-parameter tri-modal model on 6.4T tokens, demonstrating the capabilities of a unified design and achieving strong results in text generation, text-to-image tasks, and text-to-speech tasks. Our work represents the largest-scale systematic open study of multimodal discrete diffusion models conducted to date, providing insights into scaling behaviors across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Despite the extensive literature on training loss functions, the evaluation of generalization on the validation set remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical and statistical study of how the validation criterion used for model selection affects test performance in neural classifiers, with attention to early stopping. Using fully connected networks on standard benchmarks under $k$-fold evaluation, we compare: (i) early stopping with patience and (ii) post-hoc selection over all epochs (i.e. no early stopping). Models are trained with cross-entropy, C-Loss, or PolyLoss; the model parameter selection on the validation set is made using accuracy or one of the three loss functions, each considered independently. Three main findings emerge. (1) Early stopping based on validation accuracy performs worst, consistently selecting checkpoints with lower test accuracy than both loss-based early stopping and post-hoc selection. (2) Loss-based validation criteria yield comparable and more stable test accuracy. (3) Across datasets and folds, any single validation rule often underperforms the test-optimal checkpoint. Overall, the selected model typically achieves test-set performance statistically lower than the best performance across all epochs, regardless of the validation criterion. Our results suggest avoiding validation accuracy (in particular with early stopping) for parameter selection, favoring loss-based validation criteria.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance. We release our implementation at https://github.com/StigLidu/GradAlign

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) are characterized by uneven intervals between consecutive timestamps, which carry sampling pattern information valuable and informative for learning temporal and variable dependencies. In addition, IMTS often exhibit diverse dependencies across multiple time scales. However, many existing multi-scale IMTS methods use resampling to obtain the coarse series, which can alter the original timestamps and disrupt the sampling pattern information. To address the challenge, we propose ReIMTS, a Recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Instead of resampling, ReIMTS keeps timestamps unchanged and recursively splits each sample into subsamples with progressively shorter time periods. Based on the original sampling timestamps in these long-to-short subsamples, an irregularity-aware representation fusion mechanism is proposed to capture global-to-local dependencies for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average performance improvement of 27.1\% in the forecasting task across different models and real-world datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ladbaby/PyOmniTS.

Abstract: Robust watermarking is critical for intellectual property protection, whereas existing methods face a severe vulnerability against regeneration-based AIGC attacks. We identify that existing methods fail because they entangle the watermark with high-frequency cover texture, which is susceptible to being rewritten during generative purification. To address this, we propose WaterVIB, a theoretically grounded framework that reformulates the encoder as an information sieve via the Variational Information Bottleneck. Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration. We theoretically prove that optimizing this bottleneck is a necessary condition for robustness against distribution-shifting attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterVIB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior zero-shot resilience against unknown diffusion-based editing.

Abstract: Open-source native GUI agents still lag behind closed-source systems on long-horizon navigation tasks. This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising performance in pre-training large language models through gradient (or momentum) orthogonalization. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective enhancement to Muon, namely Muon+, which introduces an additional normalization step after orthogonalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Muon+ through extensive pre-training experiments across a wide range of model scales and architectures. Our evaluation includes GPT-style models ranging from 130M to 774M parameters and LLaMA-style models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Muon+ in the compute-optimal training regime and further extend the token-to-parameter (T2P) ratio to an industrial level of $\approx 200$. Experimental results show that Muon+ provides a consistent boost on training and validation perplexity over Muon. We provide our code here: https://github.com/K1seki221/MuonPlus.

Abstract: Gene expression prediction, which predicts mRNA expression levels from DNA sequences, presents significant challenges. Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) learn to sample diverse candidates in proportion to a reward function, making them well-suited for scientific discovery, where exploring multiple promising solutions is crucial. Further extending GFlowNets to multi-objective settings has attracted growing interest since real-world applications often involve multiple, conflicting objectives. However, existing approaches require additional training for each set of objectives, limiting their applicability and incurring substantial computational overhead. We propose a training-free mixing policy that composes pre-trained GFlowNets at inference time, enabling rapid adaptation without finetuning or retraining. Importantly, our framework is flexible, capable of handling diverse reward combinations ranging from linear scalarization to complex non-linear logical operators, which are often handled separately in previous literature. We prove that our method exactly recovers the target distribution for linear scalarization and quantify the approximation quality for nonlinear operators through a distortion factor. Experiments on a synthetic 2D grid and real-world molecule-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to baselines that require additional training.

Abstract: Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces.

Abstract: Agent-based epidemic models (ABMs) encode behavioral and policy heterogeneity but are too slow for nightly hospital planning. We develop county-ready surrogates that learn directly from exascale ABM trajectories using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs): mechanistic SEIR-family ODEs with a neural-parameterized contact rate $κ_φ(u,t)$ (no additive residual). Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits. Inference runs in seconds on commodity CPUs (20-35 s per $\sim$90-day forecast), enabling nightly ''what-if'' sweeps on a laptop. Relative to a $\sim$100 CPU-hour ABM reference run, this yields $\sim10^{4}\times$ lower wall-clock per scenario. This closes the realism-cadence gap, supports threshold-aware decision-making (e.g., maintaining ICU occupancy $<75$%), preserves mechanistic interpretability, and enables calibrated, risk-aware scenario planning on standard institutional hardware. Beyond epidemics, the ABM$\to$UDE recipe provides a portable path to distill agent-based simulators into fast, trustworthy surrogates for other scientific domains.

Abstract: Generative images have proliferated on Web platforms in social media and online copyright distribution scenarios, and semantic watermarking has increasingly been integrated into diffusion models to support reliable provenance tracking and forgery prevention for web content. Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification. Extensive empirical results show that CSI consistently outperforms prevailing attack baselines against content-aware semantic watermarking, revealing a fundamental security weakness of current semantic watermark designs when confronted with LLM-driven semantic perturbations.

Abstract: Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) facilitate complex logical reasoning over incomplete knowledge structures, yet their training efficiency and expressivity are constrained by rigid query-level batching and structure-exclusive embeddings. We present NGDB-Zoo, a unified framework that resolves these bottlenecks by synergizing operator-level training with semantic augmentation. By decoupling logical operators from query topologies, NGDB-Zoo transforms the training loop into a dynamically scheduled data-flow execution, enabling multi-stream parallelism and achieving a $1.8\times$ - $6.8\times$ throughput compared to baselines. Furthermore, we formalize a decoupled architecture to integrate high-dimensional semantic priors from Pre-trained Text Encoders (PTEs) without triggering I/O stalls or memory overflows. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, including massive graphs like ogbl-wikikg2 and ATLAS-Wiki, demonstrate that NGDB-Zoo maintains high GPU utilization across diverse logical patterns and significantly mitigates representation friction in hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: High stress occurs when 3D heterogeneous IC packages are subjected to thermal cycling at extreme temperatures. Stress mainly occurs at the interface between different materials. We investigate stress image using latent space representation which is based on using deep generative model (DGM). However, most DGM approaches are unsupervised, meaning they resort to image pairing (input and output) to train DGM. Instead, we rely on a recent boundary-decoder (BD) net, which uses boundary condition and image pairing for stress modeling. The boundary net maps material parameters to the latent space co-shared by its image counterpart. Because such a setup is dimensionally wise ill-posed, we further couple BD net with deep clustering. To access the performance of our proposed method, we simulate an IC chip dataset comprising of 1825 stress images. We compare our new approach using variants of BD net as well as a baseline approach. We show that our approach is able to outperform all the comparison in terms of train and test error reduction.

Abstract: Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction is critical in advertising, recommender systems, and e-commerce. In practice, LTV data patterns vary across decision scenarios. As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics. Online bucket-level analysis further indicates improved ranking consistency and value calibration, especially for high-value and negative-LTV segments. We summarize practitioner-oriented takeaways: use MCTS for rapid adaptation to new data patterns, use EA for stable refinement, and validate deployment readiness with bucket-level ranking and calibration diagnostics. The proposed AgentLTV has been successfully deployed online.

Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models often underperform in real-world settings due to poor calibration, limited transportability, and subgroup disparities. These challenges are amplified in high-dimensional multimodal cancer datasets characterized by complex feature interactions and a p >> n structure. We present a fully reproducible multimodal machine learning framework for 5-year overall survival prediction in breast cancer, integrating clinical variables with high-dimensional transcriptomic and copy-number alteration (CNA) features from the METABRIC cohort.
  After variance- and sparsity-based filtering and dimensionality reduction, models were trained using stratified train/validation/test splits with validation-based hyperparameter tuning. Two survival approaches were compared: an elastic-net regularized Cox model (CoxNet) and a gradient-boosted survival tree model implemented using XGBoost. CoxNet provides embedded feature selection and stable estimation, whereas XGBoost captures nonlinear effects and higher-order interactions.
  Performance was assessed using time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC), average precision (AP), calibration curves, Brier score, and bootstrapped 95 percent confidence intervals. CoxNet achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.3 and 96.6, with AP values of 90.1 and 80.4. XGBoost achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.6 and 92.5, with AP values of 92.5 and 79.9. Fairness diagnostics showed stable discrimination across age groups, estrogen receptor status, molecular subtypes, and menopausal state.
  This work introduces a governance-oriented multimodal survival framework emphasizing calibration, fairness auditing, robustness, and reproducibility for high-dimensional clinical machine learning.

Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) solves complex tasks that require coordination from multiple agents, but is often limited to either local (independent learning) or global (centralized learning) perspectives. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequential training scheme and MARL architecture, which learns from multiple perspectives on different hierarchy levels. We propose the Hierarchical Lead Critic (HLC) - inspired by natural emerging distributions in team structures, where following high-level objectives combines with low-level execution. HLC demonstrates that introducing multiple hierarchies, leveraging local and global perspectives, can lead to improved performance with high sample efficiency and robust policies. Experimental results conducted on cooperative, non-communicative, and partially observable MARL benchmarks demonstrate that HLC outperforms single hierarchy baselines and scales robustly with increasing amounts of agents and difficulty.

Abstract: A central challenge in scientific machine learning (ML) is the correct representation of physical systems governed by multi-regime behaviours. In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF.

Abstract: Operator learning has the potential to strongly impact scientific computing by learning solution operators for differential equations, potentially accelerating multi-query tasks such as design optimization and uncertainty quantification by orders of magnitude. Despite proven universal approximation properties, deep operator networks (DeepONets) often exhibit limited accuracy and generalization in practice, which hinders their adoption. Understanding these limitations is therefore crucial for further advancing the approach.
  This work analyzes performance limitations of the classical DeepONet architecture. It is shown that the approximation error is dominated by the branch network when the internal dimension is sufficiently large, and that the learned trunk basis can often be replaced by classical basis functions without a significant impact on performance.
  To investigate this further, a modified DeepONet is constructed in which the trunk network is replaced by the left singular vectors of the training solution matrix. This modification yields several key insights. First, a spectral bias in the branch network is observed, with coefficients of dominant, low-frequency modes learned more effectively. Second, due to singular-value scaling of the branch coefficients, the overall branch error is dominated by modes with intermediate singular values rather than the smallest ones. Third, using a shared branch network for all mode coefficients, as in the standard architecture, improves generalization of small modes compared to a stacked architecture in which coefficients are computed separately. Finally, strong and detrimental coupling between modes in parameter space is identified.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in networked industrial systems, such as supply chains and power networks, is notoriously difficult due to unknown and dynamically evolving interdependencies among geographically distributed clients. These clients represent heterogeneous physical processes and industrial assets equipped with sensors that generate large volumes of nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous IoT data. Classical RCA methods require partial or full knowledge of the system's dependency graph, which is rarely available in these complex networks. While federated learning (FL) offers a natural framework for decentralized settings, most existing FL methods assume homogeneous feature spaces and retrainable client models. These assumptions are not compatible with our problem setting. Different clients have different data features and often run fixed, proprietary models that cannot be modified. This paper presents a federated cross-client interdependency learning methodology for feature-partitioned, nonlinear time-series data, without requiring access to raw sensor streams or modifying proprietary client models. Each proprietary local client model is augmented with a Machine Learning (ML) model that encodes cross-client interdependencies. These ML models are coordinated via a global server that enforces representation consistency while preserving privacy through calibrated differential privacy noise. RCA is performed using model residuals and anomaly flags. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and validate our approach on extensive simulations and a real-world industrial cybersecurity dataset.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been used in many studies to synthesise mixed tabular data. Conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) have been the most popular variant but struggle to effectively navigate the risk-utility trade-off. Bayesian GAN have received less attention for tabular data, but have been explored with unstructured data such as images and text. The most used technique employed in Bayesian GAN is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but it is computationally intensive, particularly in terms of weight storage. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Approximation of CTGAN (GACTGAN), an integration of the Bayesian posterior approximation technique using Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) within the CTGAN generator to synthesise tabular data, reducing computational overhead after the training phase. We demonstrate that GACTGAN yields better synthetic data compared to CTGAN, achieving better preservation of tabular structure and inferential statistics with less privacy risk. These results highlight GACTGAN as a simpler, effective implementation of Bayesian tabular synthesis.

Abstract: Critical applications in areas such as medicine, robotics and autonomous systems require compact (i.e., memory efficient), uncertainty-aware neural networks suitable for edge and other resource-constrained deployments. We study compact spectral circulant and block-circulant-with-circulant-blocks (BCCB) layers: FFT-diagonalizable circular convolutions whose weights live directly in the real FFT (RFFT) half (1D) or half-plane (2D). Parameterizing filters in the frequency domain lets us impose simple spectral structure, perform structured variational inference in a low-dimensional weight space, and calculate exact layer spectral norms, enabling inexpensive global Lipschitz bounds and margin-based robustness diagnostics. By placing independent complex Gaussians on the Hermitian support we obtain a discrete instance of the spectral representation of stationary kernels, inducing an exact stationary Gaussian-process prior over filters on the discrete circle/torus. We exploit this to define a practical spectral prior and a Hermitian-aware low-rank-plus-diagonal variational posterior in real coordinates. Empirically, spectral circulant/BCCB layers are effective compact building blocks in both (variational) Bayesian and point estimate regimes: compact Bayesian neural networks on MNIST->Fashion-MNIST, variational heads on frozen CIFAR-10 features, and deterministic ViT projections on CIFAR-10/Tiny ImageNet; spectral layers match strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters and with tighter Lipschitz certificates.

Abstract: In recent years, the machine learning community has increasingly embraced the optimal transport (OT) framework for modeling distributional relationships. In this work, we introduce a sample-based neural solver for computing the Wasserstein geodesic between a source and target distribution, along with the associated velocity field. Building on the dynamical formulation of the optimal transport (OT) problem, we recast the constrained optimization as a minimax problem, using deep neural networks to approximate the relevant functions. This approach not only provides the Wasserstein geodesic but also recovers the OT map, enabling direct sampling from the target distribution. By estimating the OT map, we obtain velocity estimates along particle trajectories, which in turn allow us to learn the full velocity field. The framework is flexible and readily extends to general cost functions, including the commonly used quadratic cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) has emerged as a principled approach to produce reliable uncertainty estimates by integrating deep neural networks with Bayesian inference, and the selection of informative prior distributions remains a significant challenge. Various function-space variational inference (FSVI) regularisation methods have been presented, assigning meaningful priors over model predictions. However, these methods typically rely on a Gaussian prior, which fails to capture the heavy-tailed statistical characteristics inherent in neural network outputs. By contrast, this work proposes a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework -- termed ST-FS-EB -- which employs heavy-tailed Student's $t$ priors in both parameter and function spaces. Also, we approximate the posterior distribution through variational inference (VI), inducing an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various VI-based BDL baselines, and the results demonstrate its robust performance in in-distribution prediction, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and handling distribution shifts.

Abstract: Disease progression modeling provides a robust framework to identify long-term disease trajectories from short-term biomarker data. It is a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of diseases with a long disease trajectory, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key limitation of most disease progression models is that they are specific to a single data type (e.g., continuous data), thereby limiting their applicability to heterogeneous, real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixed Events model, a novel disease progression model that handles both discrete and continuous data types. This model is implemented within the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) framework, resulting in Mixed-SuStaIn, enabling subtype and progression modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixed-SuStaIn through simulation experiments and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, showing that it performs well on mixed datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/ucl-pond/pySuStaIn.

Abstract: We study the basic task of mean estimation in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound. Our techniques make critical use of Fourier analysis, and in particular introduce the notion of a Fourier witness as an essential ingredient of our upper and lower bounds.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are essential for performing advanced tasks on edge or mobile devices, yet their deployment is often hindered by severe resource constraints, including limited memory, energy, and computational power. While uniform quantization provides a straightforward approach to compress model and reduce hardware requirement, it fails to fully leverage the varying robustness across layers, and often lead to accuracy degradation or suboptimal resource usage, particularly at low bitwidths. In contrast, heterogeneous quantization, which allocates different bitwidths to individual layers, can mitigate these drawbacks. Nonetheless, current heterogeneous quantization methods either needs huge brute-force design space search or lacks the adaptability to meet different hardware conditions, such as memory size, energy budget, and latency requirement.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a significant role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF.

Abstract: In many applications, it is important to identify subpopulations that survive longer or shorter than the rest of the population. In medicine, for example, it allows determining which patients benefit from treatment, and in predictive maintenance, which components are more likely to fail. Existing methods for discovering subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics require restrictive assumptions about the survival model (e.g. proportional hazards), pre-discretized features, and, as they compare average statistics, tend to overlook individual deviations. In this paper, we propose Sysurv, a fully differentiable, non-parametric method that leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions and how to combine these into inherently interpretable rules, so as to select subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets and settings, including a case study on cancer data, shows that Sysurv reveals insightful and actionable survival subgroups.

Abstract: Modelling rock-fluid interaction requires solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) to predict the flow behaviour and the reactions of the fluid with the rock on the interfaces. Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction.

Abstract: Soft set theory provides a direct framework for parameterized decision modeling by assigning to each attribute (parameter) a subset of a given universe, thereby representing uncertainty in a structured way [1, 2]. Over the past decades, the theory has expanded into numerous variants-including hypersoft sets, superhypersoft sets, TreeSoft sets, bipolar soft sets, and dynamic soft sets-and has been connected to diverse areas such as topology and matroid theory. In this book, we present a survey-style overview of soft sets and their major extensions, highlighting core definitions, representative constructions, and key directions of current development.

Motivation: 地球科学数据快速积累导致可扩展性挑战，PANGAEA等存储库中大量数据集未充分利用，限制了数据重用性

Method: 提出分层多智能体框架，采用集中式Supervisor-Worker拓扑结构，包含数据类型感知路由、沙盒确定性代码执行和执行反馈自校正机制

Abstract: The rapid accumulation of Earth science data has created a significant scalability challenge; while repositories like PANGAEA host vast collections of datasets, citation metrics indicate that a substantial portion remains underutilized, limiting data reusability. Here we present PANGAEA-GPT, a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed for autonomous data discovery and analysis. Unlike standard Large Language Model (LLM) wrappers, our architecture implements a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with strict data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback, enabling agents to diagnose and resolve runtime errors. Through use-case scenarios spanning physical oceanography and ecology, we demonstrate the system's capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention. This framework provides a methodology for querying and analyzing heterogeneous repository data through coordinated agent workflows.

TL;DR: Agentic reinforcement learning (ARL) suffers from training instability which limits its scalability and reproducibility. This paper introduces ARLArena as a standardized testbed and analysis framework to diagnose instability sources, and proposes SAMPO—a stable optimization method that improves training robustness across diverse agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Agent强化学习（ARL）在解决复杂、多步骤的交互任务方面展现出潜力，但当前的训练过程极不稳定，容易出现训练崩溃，这限制了其在大规模环境、长交互时长上的可扩展性，也阻碍了对算法设计选择的系统性探索。

Method: 本文首先提出了ARLArena框架，构建了一个干净、标准化的测试平台，并将策略梯度分解为四个核心设计维度进行评估。基于此精细分析，作者提出了一种统一的ARL视角，并进而设计了SAMPO（稳定智能体策略优化方法），旨在缓解ARL中主导的不稳定性来源。

Result: 实验结果表明，SAMPO能够在多种智能体任务中实现稳定的训练和强劲的性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为ARL提供了一个统一的策略梯度视角，并为构建稳定、可复现的基于大语言模型的智能体训练流程提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (ARL) has rapidly gained attention as a promising paradigm for training agents to solve complex, multi-step interactive tasks. Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.

Abstract: When designing compound AI systems, a common approach is to query multiple copies of the same model and aggregate the responses to produce a synthesized output. Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了ASIR勇气模型，这是一个将真相揭露视为动态状态转换而非人格特质的框架，适用于人类和AI系统在风险下的信息共享分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上将勇气视为人格特质，但作者认为真相揭露是受多种力量相互作用影响的动态系统状态转换。为了统一解释人类在压力下的沉默和AI系统在政策约束下的偏好驱动扭曲，需要建立形式化框架来分析真相披露的动力学机制。

Method: 提出ASIR勇气模型，将真话披露建模为从抑制状态(S0)到表达状态(S1)的相变过程，用数学不等式λ(1+γ)+ψ > θ+φ描述各力量相互作用。该框架还扩展了反馈机制，研究参数递归校准和路径依赖效应。

Result: 模型成功将人类真相披露和AI合规输出统一在同一动力学框架下，揭示了系统状态转变的几何特性而非主体意图，为跨人机系统的风险信息共享提供了形式化分析工具。

Conclusion: ASIR勇气模型为理解风险环境下的真相披露提供了统一的动力学框架，超越了传统的人格特质视角，为人机协作环境中的信息共享机制研究开辟了新的理论视角。

Abstract: We introduce the ASIR (Awakened Shared Intelligence Relationship) Courage Model, a phase-dynamic framework that formalizes truth-disclosure as a state transition rather than a personality trait. The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.
  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.
  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了fEDM+框架，扩展了原有的模糊伦理决策框架，通过添加可解释性模块和多参考验证机制，提升了AI伦理决策的透明度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原fEDM框架虽然保证了形式严谨性和决策一致性，但存在两个关键挑战：缺乏决策的原理解释性，以及在伦理多元主义下的鲁棒性不足。为解决这些问题，作者需要开发能够提供透明解释、并能处理多种伦理观点冲突的扩展框架。

Method: 1. 引入可解释性和可追溯性模块（ETM），明确将伦理决策规则与底层道德原则关联，计算每个推荐行动的加权原则贡献度。2. 用多元语义验证框架替代单一参考验证，通过编码不同原则优先级和风险容忍度的多个利益相关者参考标准来评估决策。

Result: 扩展后的fEDM+框架保持了形式可验证性，同时显著增强了可解释性，提供了透明、可审计的决策解释，并能够正式表示不同利益相关者之间的伦理分歧。

Conclusion: fEDM+通过在伦理决策中集成可解释性和多元验证机制，为伦理敏感AI系统提供了适合的监督和治理层，平衡了形式严谨性、透明度和伦理多元性这三大关键要求。

Abstract: In a previous work, we introduced the fuzzy Ethical Decision-Making framework (fEDM), a risk-based ethical reasoning architecture grounded in fuzzy logic. The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.

TL;DR: 采用STAR推理框架可将洗车问题的解决准确率从0%提升至85%，结合用户档案和RAG上下文可实现100%准确率，表明结构化推理比上下文注入更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决洗车问题（需要隐含物理约束推理的病毒式推理基准）上持续失败，需要研究哪些提示架构层能够实现正确推理。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet进行变量隔离研究（共120次试验），控制超参数，比较不同提示架构层的效果：基础条件、STAR推理框架、添加用户档案上下文、添加RAG上下文以及完整堆栈条件。

Result: STAR推理框架单独将准确率从0%提升至85%（p=0.001）；添加用户档案上下文再提高10个百分点；RAG上下文再提高5个百分点，最终在完整堆栈条件下达到100%准确率。

Conclusion: 结构化推理框架（特别是推理前强制目标表述）对于隐含约束推理任务的影响远大于上下文注入，这为提升语言模型的物理推理能力提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models consistently fail the "car wash problem," a viral reasoning benchmark requiring implicit physical constraint inference. We present a variable isolation study (n=20 per condition, 6 conditions, 120 total trials) examining which prompt architecture layers in a production system enable correct reasoning. Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0.7, top_p 1.0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio 13.22). Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition. These results suggest that structured reasoning scaffolds -- specifically, forced goal articulation before inference -- matter substantially more than context injection for implicit constraint reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Complex claim verification requires decomposing sentences into verifiable subclaims, yet existing methods struggle to align decomposition quality with verification performance. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that jointly optimizes decomposition quality and verifier alignment using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method integrates: (i) structured sequential reasoning; (ii) supervised finetuning on teacher-distilled exemplars; and (iii) a multi-objective reward balancing format compliance, verifier alignment, and decomposition quality. Across six evaluation settings, our trained 8B decomposer improves downstream verification performance to (71.75%) macro-F1, outperforming prompt-based approaches ((+1.99), (+6.24)) and existing RL methods ((+5.84)). Human evaluation confirms the high quality of the generated subclaims. Our framework enables smaller language models to achieve state-of-the-art claim verification by jointly optimising for verification accuracy and decomposition quality.

Abstract: Across a growing number of fields, human decision making is supported by predictions from AI models. However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典规划中的基础化步骤常因任务规模扩大时基础化操作和原子呈指数增长而成为计算瓶颈。现有部分基础化方法虽然能增量基础化有潜力的操作，但主要依赖关系特征或学习嵌入，未能利用PDDL描述中包含的文本和结构信息来提高基础化效率和精度。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLMs）分析PDDL领域文件和问题文件，启发式地识别潜在无关的对象、动作和谓词，从而在基础化前减少任务规模，这属于部分基础化方法的扩展，但特别利用了PDDL描述的文本和结构信息来指导选择过程。

Result: 在七个难以基础化的基准测试中，SPG-LLM能实现更快的基础化过程（通常快数个数量级），同时在部分领域获得了相当或更好的规划成本。这表明利用LLM分析PDDL信息可以在不影响规划质量的情况下显著减少基础化的计算负担。

Conclusion: SPG-LLM通过利用LLM分析PDDL描述的文本和结构线索，能够有效识别不相关的对象、动作和谓词，显著减少基础化任务规模。在七个难以基础化的基准测试中，该方法实现了更快的基础化过程（通常快数个数量级），同时在部分领域获得了相当或更好的规划成本，为解决规划任务中基础化的计算瓶颈问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Grounding is a critical step in classical planning, yet it often becomes a computational bottleneck due to the exponential growth in grounded actions and atoms as task size increases. Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于Petri网可达性松弛的方法，用于鲁棒的动态规划，包括不变式合成、目标不可达检测和可解释性分析，支持增量约束求解，在不可行性检测和顺序规划更新方面优于基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的规划方法主要集中在可行情况下的高效一次性规划，缺乏对规划领域更新和不可行性检测的支持。当计划因情况变化或理解变化而需要调整时，或者当根本不存在可行计划时，需要有效的方法来检测不可行性并调整需求。

Method: 提出基于Petri网可达性松弛的方法，支持鲁棒的不变式合成、高效的目标不可达检测和有用的不可行性解释。进一步利用增量约束求解器来支持目标和约束的更新。

Result: 经验评估表明，与基准方法相比，该系统：1) 产生可比数量的不变式；2) 检测到多达2倍的不可行性；3) 在一次性规划中具有竞争力；4) 在测试领域中顺序规划更新方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过Petri网可达性松弛和增量约束求解，有效解决了动态规划中的不可行性检测和持续更新问题，在识别不可行性和支持顺序规划更新方面优于现有方法，为自适应规划系统提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Plans often change due to changes in the situation or our understanding of the situation. Sometimes, a feasible plan may not even exist, and identifying such infeasibilities is useful to determine when requirements need adjustment. Common planning approaches focus on efficient one-shot planning in feasible cases rather than updating domains or detecting infeasibility. We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates. Empirically, compared to baselines, our system produces a comparable number of invariants, detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and outperforms in sequential plan updates in the tested domains.
