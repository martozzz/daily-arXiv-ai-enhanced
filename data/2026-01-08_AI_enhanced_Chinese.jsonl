Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.\n  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77).

While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative \"eureka moments\" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \\emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence.

As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "LFMs\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e0eN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u77db\u76fe\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LFMs\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LFMs\u751f\u6210\u5e72\u9884\u5019\u9009\u5217\u8868\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "LFMs\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LFMs\u548cN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u7684\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u64c5\u957f\u4ece\u7fa4\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u64c5\u957f\u4e2a\u4f53\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms.

This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8).

Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline.

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9886\u57df\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u836f\u7269\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5c06\u836f\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u4ece\u6700\u591a7\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u81f3\u5c1128\u79cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u836f\u7269\u89c4\u5212\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4f4d\u60a3\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u836f\u7269\u548c\u5242\u91cf\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6700\u591a7\u79cd\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6307\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5b9a\u4e49\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GBFS\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u836f\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u81f3\u5c1128\u79cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u836f\u7269\u89c4\u5212\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions.

We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed.

In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding.

In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding.

Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class.

The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network.

In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting.

Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples.

Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data.

By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, \"plug-and-play\" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
