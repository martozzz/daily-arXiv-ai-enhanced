### [1] [ConvoLearn: A Dataset of Constructivist Tutor-Student Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08950)
*Mayank Sharma,Roy Pea,Hari Subramonyam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConvoLearn, a dataset for improving LLMs in educational contexts, showing significant improvements in pedagogical behavior through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning.

Method: We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies.

Result: Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall.

Conclusion: This work establishes a potential framework to guide future development and evaluation of constructivist AI tutors.

Abstract: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning. We introduce ConvoLearn (https://huggingface.co/datasets/masharma/convolearn ), a dataset grounded in knowledge building theory that operationalizes six core pedagogical dimensions: cognitive engagement, formative assessment, accountability, cultural responsiveness, metacognition, and power dynamics. We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies. Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall.

*Derrick Goh Xin Deik,Quanyu Long,Zhengyuan Liu,Nancy F. Chen,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过分离推理与执行，显著提升了多约束规划任务的性能并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在多约束规划问题中存在一致性和灵活性不足的问题，SCOPE旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 引入SCOPE框架，分离查询特定推理与通用代码执行，生成可重用且一致的求解器函数。

Result: SCOPE在TravelPlanner任务上达到93.1%的成功率，比最佳基线（CoT）提高了61.6%，同时降低了1.4倍推理成本和约4.67倍时间。

Conclusion: SCOPE框架通过将特定查询的推理与通用代码执行分离，实现了在多约束规划问题中生成一致、确定且可重用的求解器函数，显著提升了性能并降低了成本和延迟。

Abstract: Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

*Lixiang Zhang,Chenggong Zhao,Qing Gao,Xiaoke Zhao,Gengyi Bai,Jinhu Lv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DScheLLM uses fine-tuned large language models in a dual-system architecture to improve dynamic scheduling, showing promise for adaptive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional event-specific models in dynamic scheduling, which lack adaptability and generalization across unseen disturbances.

Method: The approach fine-tunes the Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model using LoRA within a dual-system reasoning architecture, with training datasets generated from exact schedules provided by an operations research solver.

Result: Experimental results show that the fast-thinking mode efficiently generates high-quality schedules, while the slow-thinking mode produces well-formatted decision inputs compatible with solvers.

Conclusion: DScheLLM demonstrates the potential of large language models in dynamic scheduling by combining fast and slow reasoning modes, achieving high-quality schedules and solver-compatible inputs.

Abstract: Production scheduling is highly susceptible to dynamic disruptions, such as variations in processing times, machine availability, and unexpected task insertions. Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.

TL;DR: Survey on memory in LLMs/MLLMs: implicit, explicit, and agentic frameworks, their roles, and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured overview of memory's role in LLMs and MLLMs, addressing gaps in understanding and application across different memory paradigms.

Method: The survey synthesizes literature into a taxonomy of memory paradigms, discussing implicit memory (internal parameters), explicit memory (external storage), and agentic memory (autonomous agents).

Result: A comprehensive taxonomy of memory frameworks is presented, alongside key architectural advances and open challenges in memory capacity, alignment, and interoperability.

Conclusion: Memory mechanisms are pivotal in enhancing the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of LLMs and MLLMs. The survey organizes memory paradigms into implicit, explicit, and agentic frameworks, highlighting their roles in model performance and interaction.

Abstract: Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI research has intensified the Reviewer Gap, threatening the peer-review sustainability and perpetuating a cycle of low-quality evaluations. This position paper critiques existing LLM approaches that automatically generate reviews and argues for a paradigm shift that positions LLMs as tools for assisting and educating human reviewers. We define the core principles of high-quality peer review and propose two complementary systems grounded in these foundations: (i) an LLM-assisted mentoring system that cultivates reviewers' long-term competencies, and (ii) an LLM-assisted feedback system that helps reviewers refine the quality of their reviews. This human-centered approach aims to strengthen reviewer expertise and contribute to building a more sustainable scholarly ecosystem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT-Flow introduces a continuous probabilistic flow approach to quantify reasoning steps, enhancing efficiency and performance in chain-of-thought processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current paradigms lack granularity in quantifying step-wise information gain, leading to inefficiency and optimization challenges.

Method: The framework reconceptualizes reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, enabling flow-guided decoding and flow-based reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show that CoT-Flow improves inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

Conclusion: CoT-Flow provides a novel approach to quantifying and optimizing reasoning steps in chain-of-thought processes, achieving a superior balance between efficiency and performance.

Abstract: High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决疫情防控中政策碎片化和反应滞后的问题，提升跨区域协调干预能力。

Method: 采用LLM多智能体框架，结合流行病学动态模拟和跨区域通信，进行闭环政策模拟。

Result: 在2020年美国州级数据验证中，累计感染和死亡分别减少63.7%和40.1%（州级）及39.0%和27.0%（跨州汇总）。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统能显著提升疫情防控效果，为未来公共卫生危机提供新工具。

Abstract: Effective pandemic control requires timely and coordinated policymaking across administrative regions that are intrinsically interdependent. However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking...

TL;DR: RISER 是一种自适应激活空间干预框架，通过动态组合推理向量提升 LLM 推理效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活导向方法依赖静态、手动干预，无法适应复杂推理的动态特性。

Method: RISER 构建了一个可重用的推理向量库，并通过轻量级 Router 动态组合这些向量。Router 通过强化学习在任务级奖励下优化，以涌现和组合的方式激活潜在的认知原语。

Result: 在七个多样化基准测试中，RISER 平均零样本准确率提高了 3.4-6.5%，同时比 CoT 风格推理效率高出 2-3 倍，并保持了稳健的准确率提升。

Conclusion: RISER 是一个高效的插件式干预框架，通过动态组合可重用的推理向量，显著提升了大型语言模型在零样本任务中的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $A^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating memory-driven scientific reasoning using dual-scale activation (anchors and attractors), validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in existing benchmarks that overlook memory-driven mechanisms in scientific reasoning by proposing $A^3$-Bench, which evaluates reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation.

Method: The study involves annotating 2,198 science reasoning problems using the SAPM process and introduces a dual-scale memory evaluation framework with the AAUI metric to measure memory activation rates.

Result: The results demonstrate the benchmark's utility in analyzing memory activation's impact on reasoning performance, validated through experiments with various base models and paradigms.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by validating the $A^3$-Bench benchmark through experiments with various models, highlighting its effectiveness in analyzing memory-driven scientific reasoning. The results provide insights into how memory activation influences reasoning performance.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: STaR是一个无需参数的推理时遗忘框架，通过语义感知检测、全局安全约束注入、轨迹感知抑制和令牌级自适应过滤，全面保护大型推理模型中的隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在生成复杂思维链时可能嵌入敏感信息，现有遗忘方法仅修改最终答案，无法消除中间步骤的隐私泄露。

Method: 提出STaR框架，包括敏感内容检测、安全提示前缀注入、轨迹感知抑制和令牌级过滤。

Result: 在R-TOFU基准测试中，STaR以最小效用损失实现全面稳定的遗忘。

Conclusion: STaR为大型推理模型的隐私保护推理设定了新标准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.

Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.

Abstract: Lane-free traffic environments allow vehicles to better harness the lateral capacity of the road without being restricted to lane-keeping, thereby increasing the traffic flow rates. As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.

Abstract: Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation. The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/CoraLiang01/lean-llm-opt.

Abstract: While GUI agents have shown strong performance under explicit and completion instructions, real-world deployment requires aligning with users' more complex implicit intents. In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.

Abstract: Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGFMs propose a physics-inspired alternative to transformers, using continuous field evolution in a wavelet basis for generative modeling, improving coherence and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of transformer-based models by introducing a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure, enabling more efficient and coherent generation of text and video.

Method: SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field using constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis, replacing global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier-Stokes-like transport.

Result: The framework introduces three key innovations: a field-theoretic ontology, a wavelet-domain representation for sparsity and efficiency, and a constrained stochastic flow for stability and coherence.

Conclusion: SGFMs provide a novel, physics-inspired approach to generative modeling, offering advantages in long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and structured inductive bias, representing a significant departure from traditional autoregressive and diffusion-based models.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), a physics-inspired alternative to transformer-based large language models. Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.
  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.

Motivation: 开发一个稳健的机器学习框架，用于预测尼泊尔证券交易所（NEPSE）指数的每日对数收益率，以模拟实际部署并避免前瞻性偏差。

Method: 使用XGBoost回归器进行一步预测，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，并使用时间序列交叉验证。特征工程包括滞后对数收益率和技术指标。

Result: 最优配置（扩展窗口和20个滞后）在多个评估指标上优于调优的ARIMA和Ridge回归基准，对数收益率RMSE为0.013450，MAE为0.009814，方向准确性为65.15%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了梯度提升集成在建模新兴市场时间序列非线性动态中的有效性，并为NEPSE指数预测建立了可复现的基准。

Abstract: This study develops a robust machine learning framework for one-step-ahead forecasting of daily log-returns in the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) Index using the XGBoost regressor. A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction. Feature importance analysis and visual inspection further enhance interpretability. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting ensembles in modeling nonlinear dynamics in volatile emerging market time series and establish a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting.

Motivation: 供应链预测模型会因现实条件变化（如促销、消费者偏好改变和供应中断）而随时间退化，导致库存问题。现有方法仅关注漂移检测，忽略了诊断和修复，且未考虑供应链数据的层次结构。

Conclusion: DriftGuard 是一个端到端系统，能够有效检测、诊断并修正供应链预测模型中的概念漂移问题，显著提高了检测召回率和投资回报率。

Abstract: Supply chain forecasting models degrade over time as real-world conditions change. Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models for molecular design, capable of capturing complex structural distributions and achieving high fidelity in 3D molecule generation. However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available in our project repository.

Conclusion: 块级公平性相比窗口级公平性具有显著优势。

Abstract: We study the problem of enforcing continuous group fairness over windows in data streams. We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets. A qualitative study further highlights the advantages of block-level fairness compared to window-level fairness.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of solar energetic particle events is vital for safeguarding satellites, astronauts, and space-based infrastructure. Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.

Conclusion: WSD学习率调度器的性能表现不仅限于基于Transformer的语言模型，其在小CNN上的相似表现表明非凸问题的损失景观具有共享的几何特性。

Abstract: The Warmup Stable Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler has recently become popular, largely due to its good performance and flexibility when training large language models. It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.

*Samuel Myren,Nidhi Parikh,Natalie Klein*

TL;DR: Meta-learning is more effective than TDL under data shift, especially with limited data, but its benefits decrease with more data and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of data shift in real-world applications, where TDL models degrade rapidly, requiring costly relabeling and retraining. Meta-learning offers a promising alternative for quick adaptation to new data with few examples.

Method: The study systematically compares TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms, using a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) for evaluation.

Result: Meta-learning achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes. Task diversity influences performance, but alignment between training and test distributions is the key driver of gains.

Conclusion: Meta-learning outperforms traditional deep learning (TDL) in scenarios with data shift, especially in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. However, as data availability and model capacity increase, the advantages of meta-learning diminish, with TDL and fine-tuning performing comparably.

Abstract: Across engineering and scientific domains, traditional deep learning (TDL) models perform well when training and test data share the same distribution. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance parallel scalability for training increasingly large foundational models by addressing the limitations of traditional layer-serial training methods.

Method: The method involves a neural ODE formulation of transformers, applying a multilevel parallel-in-time algorithm for both forward and backpropagation phases. It includes an algorithm to detect and mitigate systematic bias in gradients by switching to serial training or increasing accuracy.

Result: Results demonstrate significant parallel acceleration across models like BERT, GPT2, ViT, and machine translation architectures, with accuracy matching serial pre-training while fine-tuning remains unaffected.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the new multilevel, layer-parallel training methodology for transformers, while introducing systematic bias in gradients, can achieve parallel acceleration and maintain accuracy comparable to serial pre-training, especially beneficial for large foundational models.

Abstract: We present a new training methodology for transformers using a multilevel, layer-parallel approach. Through a neural ODE formulation of transformers, our application of a multilevel parallel-in-time algorithm for the forward and backpropagation phases of training achieves parallel acceleration over the layer dimension. This dramatically enhances parallel scalability as the network depth increases, which is particularly useful for increasingly large foundational models. However, achieving this introduces errors that cause systematic bias in the gradients, which in turn reduces convergence when closer to the minima. We develop an algorithm to detect this critical transition and either switch to serial training or systematically increase the accuracy of layer-parallel training. Results, including BERT, GPT2, ViT, and machine translation architectures, demonstrate parallel-acceleration as well as accuracy commensurate with serial pre-training while fine-tuning is unaffected.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the SCaLE algorithm achieves a sub-linear dynamic regret in a noisy bandit feedback model, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling unbounded metric movement costs.

Abstract: This work addresses the fundamental problem of unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization, by considering high-dimensional dynamic quadratic hitting costs and $\ell_2$-norm switching costs in a noisy bandit feedback model. For a general class of stochastic environments, we provide the first algorithm SCaLE that provably achieves a distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret, without the knowledge of hitting cost structure. En-route, we present a novel spectral regret analysis that separately quantifies eigenvalue-error driven regret and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret. Extensive numerical experiments, against online-learning baselines, corroborate our claims, and highlight statistical consistency of our algorithm.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias while maintaining semantic consistency across views and compactness within clusters in incomplete multi-view clustering.

Method: The framework includes view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, a hierarchical imputation module for estimating missing cluster assignments and reconstructing missing features, an energy-based semantic alignment module for intra-cluster compactness, and a contrastive assignment alignment module for cross-view consistency.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks show that DIMVC-HIA outperforms existing methods under varying levels of missing data.

Conclusion: DIMVC-HIA is a novel deep IMVC framework that effectively addresses the challenges of incomplete multi-view clustering by integrating hierarchical imputation and alignment, achieving superior performance in scenarios with varying levels of missing data.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) aims to discover shared cluster structures from multi-view data with partial observations. The core challenges lie in accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias, while maintaining semantic consistency across views and compactness within clusters. To address these challenges, we propose DIMVC-HIA, a novel deep IMVC framework that integrates hierarchical imputation and alignment with four key components: (1) view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, coupled with a view-shared clustering predictor to produce soft cluster assignments; (2) a hierarchical imputation module that first estimates missing cluster assignments based on cross-view contrastive similarity, and then reconstructs missing features using intra-view, intra-cluster statistics; (3) an energy-based semantic alignment module, which promotes intra-cluster compactness by minimizing energy variance around low-energy cluster anchors; and (4) a contrastive assignment alignment module, which enhances cross-view consistency and encourages confident, well-separated cluster predictions. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance under varying levels of missingness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The existence of multiple, equally accurate models for a given predictive task leads to predictive multiplicity, where a ``Rashomon set'' of models achieve similar accuracy but diverges in their individual predictions. This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment. In experiments across multiple datasets, our methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables collaborative training between resource-constrained edge devices and a compute-rich server. Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices.

Abstract: We present Speculative Rollout with Tree-Structured Cache (SRT), a simple, model-free approach to accelerate on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for language models without sacrificing distributional correctness. SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a standard approach for training mathematical reasoning models; however, its reliance on multiple completions per prompt makes training computationally expensive. Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time. These gains are consistent across models, methods, and benchmarks. We will release our code, trained models, and experimental protocols.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce DASD-4B-Thinking, a lightweight yet highly capable, fully open-source reasoning model. It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling by generating multiple traces. However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Concrete is the most widely used construction material worldwide; however, reliable prediction of compressive strength remains challenging due to material heterogeneity, variable mix proportions, and sensitivity to field and environmental conditions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence enable data-driven modeling frameworks capable of supporting automated decision-making in construction quality control. This study leverages an industry-scale dataset consisting of approximately 70,000 compressive strength test records to evaluate and compare multiple predictive approaches, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, transformer-based neural networks, and embedding-based neural networks. The models incorporate key mixture design and placement variables such as water cement ratio, cementitious material content, slump, air content, temperature, and placement conditions. Results indicate that the embedding-based neural network consistently outperforms traditional machine learning and transformer-based models, achieving a mean 28-day prediction error of approximately 2.5%. This level of accuracy is comparable to routine laboratory testing variability, demonstrating the potential of embedding-based learning frameworks to enable automated, data-driven quality control and decision support in large-scale construction operations.

Abstract: Imbalanced electrocardiogram (ECG) data hampers the efficacy and resilience of algorithms in the automated processing and interpretation of cardiovascular diagnostic information, which in turn impedes deep learning-based ECG classification. Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\% and 98\%. Notably, our proposed data fusion methodology surpasses any known algorithms in terms of ECG classification accuracy in the CPSC 2018 dataset.

Abstract: Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost.

Abstract: Neural operator learning accelerates PDE solution by approximating operators as mappings between continuous function spaces. Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Using Artificial Intelligence to improve teaching and learning benefits greater adaptivity and scalability in education. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education. Future works on XAI for KT may benefit from educationally grounded conceptualization and developing stakeholder-centered methods.

Abstract: We study the Bandit Clustering (BC) problem under the fixed confidence setting, where the objective is to group a collection of data sequences (arms) into clusters through sequential sampling from adaptively selected arms at each time step while ensuring a fixed error probability at the stopping time. We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches.

Abstract: Building on the probability-domain distillation framework of Sparse-KD, we develop an axiomatic, operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation. Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.
  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes. The framework provides theoretical grounding for multi-teacher distillation from diverse frontier models while admitting multiple valid implementation strategies.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) suffers from slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to the overwhelming noise introduced to preserve privacy. While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape online content, removing targeted information from well-trained LLMs (also known as LLM unlearning) has become critical for web governance. A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($ρ\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($ρ= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying $how$ $reliably$ systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.

Abstract: The prevailing post-training paradigm for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)--Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL)--suffers from an intrinsic optimization mismatch: the rigid supervision inherent in SFT induces distributional collapse, thereby exhausting the exploration space necessary for subsequent RL. In this paper, we reformulate SFT within a unified post-training framework and propose Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT). We characterize standard SFT as a degenerate zero-temperature limit that suppresses base priors. Conversely, GIFT incorporates supervision as a finite-temperature energy potential, establishing a distributional bridge that ensures objective consistency throughout the post-training pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that GIFT significantly outperforms standard SFT and other competitive baselines when utilized for RL initialization, providing a mathematically principled pathway toward achieving global optimality in post-training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their massive computational demands. % While pruning offers a promising compression solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) They neglect activation distribution shifts between calibration data and test data, resulting in inaccurate error estimations; (2) They overlook the long-tail distribution characteristics of activations in the attention module. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3). Moreover, the dynamic attention update mechanism also generalizes well to ViT-based vision models like DeiT, achieving superior accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

Abstract: Reward design remains a significant bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems. A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., "bad," "neutral," "good"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) arise naturally in medical, social, commercial, and financial domains. However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.

Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems involve distinct physical domains, fluid and solid, governed by different partial differential equations and coupled at a dynamic interface. While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty. Extensive experiments on two constructed FSI benchmarks and a public dataset demonstrate that HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing an effective framework for surrogate modeling of coupled multi-physics systems.

Abstract: While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) are standard for LLM alignment, they either rely on costly expert data or discard valuable negative samples, leading to data inefficiency. To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks across various base models show that RIFT consistently outperforms RFT. Our results demonstrate that RIFT is a robust and data-efficient alternative for alignment using mixed-quality, self-generated data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is crucial for advancing large-scale reasoning models. However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: Despite the prevalent assumption of uniform variable importance in long-term time series forecasting models, real world applications often exhibit asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs. Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.

Abstract: Providing clear explanations to the choices of machine learning models is essential for these models to be deployed in crucial applications. Counterfactual and semi-factual explanations have emerged as two mechanisms for providing users with insights into the outputs of their models. We provide an overview of the computational complexity results in the literature for generating these explanations, finding that in many cases, generating explanations is computationally hard. We strengthen the argument for this considerably by further contributing our own inapproximability results showing that not only are explanations often hard to generate, but under certain assumptions, they are also hard to approximate. We discuss the implications of these complexity results for the XAI community and for policymakers seeking to regulate explanations in AI.

Abstract: Accurate global medium-range weather forecasting is fundamental to Earth system science. Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.
  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.
  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a critical mechanism for supporting sustainable and privacy-preserving social networks, enabling models to remove the influence of deleted nodes and thereby better safeguard user information. However, we observe that existing graph unlearning techniques insufficiently protect sensitive attributes, often leading to degraded algorithmic fairness compared with traditional graph learning methods. To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings highlight a previously overlooked risk in current unlearning practices and establish FairGU as a robust and equitable solution for the next generation of socially sustainable networked systems. The codes are available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGU.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Model merging enables multiple large language models (LLMs) to be combined into a single model while preserving performance. This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \simmerge{}, \emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed learning across multiple clients without sharing raw data. When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round. These results indicate that DC-CFL is a practical alternative for collaborative AI model development when multiple communication rounds are impractical.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper introduces ACS2HER, a novel integration of the Anticipatory Classifier System (ACS2) with the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism. While ACS2 is highly effective at building cognitive maps through latent learning, its performance often stagnates in environments characterized by sparse rewards. We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \texttt{FrozenLake}. The results demonstrate that ACS2HER significantly accelerates knowledge acquisition and environmental mastery compared to the standard ACS2. However, this efficiency gain is accompanied by increased computational overhead and a substantial expansion in classifier numerosity. This work provides the first analysis of combining anticipatory mechanisms with retrospective goal-relabeling in Learning Classifier Systems.

Abstract: Efficiently optimizing battery charging protocols is challenging because each evaluation is slow, costly, and non-differentiable. Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations). These results demonstrate that LLMs can expand the space of protocol functional forms, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in high cost experimental settings.

Abstract: We introduce a new method of generating Computer Aided Design (CAD) profiles via a sequence of simple geometric constructions including curve offsetting, rotations and intersections. These sequences start with geometry provided by a designer and build up the points and curves of the final profile step by step. We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision. In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: In optoacoustic imaging, recovering the absorption coefficients of tissue by inverting the light transport remains a challenging problem. Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general. Our results demonstrate that Sobolev training for a light transport surrogate model not only improves derivative accuracy but also reduces generalization error for in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. These improvements promise to considerably enhance the utility of the surrogate model in downstream tasks, especially in solving inverse problems.

Abstract: We address the problem of sampling from terminally constrained distributions with pre-trained flow-based generative models through an optimal control formulation. Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks are emerging as fundamental tools among various neural network types to learn mappings between function spaces, and have recently gained attention due to their ability to approximate nonlinear operators. In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a variety of tasks, yet they often suffer from unreliable probability estimates. As a result, they can be overconfident in their predictions. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a principled framework for uncertainty quantification, yielding prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees. Existing conformal training methods optimize for overall set size, but shaping the prediction sets in a class-conditional manner is not straightforward and typically requires prior knowledge of the data distribution. In this work, we introduce Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which formulates conformal training as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem that adaptively learns to shape prediction sets class-conditionally without making any distributional assumptions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including standard and long-tailed image recognition as well as text classification, demonstrate that CaCT consistently outperforms prior conformal training methods, producing significantly smaller and more informative prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage guarantees.

Additionally, we introduce a Gaussian Process score-based model with Smooth Information Criterion penalisation on the marginal likelihood, and demonstrate improved performance over existing state of the art time-series nonlinear causal discovery methods. Furthermore, we propose a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm, fully based on GC, using the proposed score-based $GP_{SIC}$ method, and compare its performance to a state of the art contemporaneous time series causal discovery algorithm.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that looped Transformers have superior reasoning capabilities compared to standard deep architectures. Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability.

Abstract: Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) have recently shown strong in-context learning capabilities on structured data, achieving zero-shot performance comparable to traditional machine learning methods. We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes. Our findings cover performance, calibration, and fairness, offering practical guidelines on when fine-tuning is most beneficial and its limitations.

Abstract: Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.
