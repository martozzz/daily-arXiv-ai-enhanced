This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness.

Building on this, we propose \\textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data. Our method orchestrates a co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM, where the Attacker generates a diverse and dynamic curriculum of image manipulations, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve.

Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon \\perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates.

Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $\u03a9(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

On the NK-Landscape, where no closed-form model exists, CWM-greedy outperforms all baselines across fifteen independently generated instances ($36.94$ vs.\\ $36.32$; $p<0.001$) when the prompt includes empirical transition statistics. The CWM also outperforms DQN in sample efficiency (200 offline trajectories vs.\\ 500 online episodes), success rate (100\\% vs.\\ 58\\%), and generalization ($k{=}3$: 78\\% vs.\\ 0\\%).

A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u801767.5%\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7b80\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f468%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630193.6%\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u5f15\u53d1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u90e8\u7f72\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Gemma3 1B\u30014B\u548cQwen3 4B\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e67.5%\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u7ea668%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630193.6%\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u630193.6%\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This enables low-overhead context assembly and online memory update without expensive LLM training. However, existing solutions remain passive and reactive; memory growth is bounded by information that happens to be available, while memory agents seldom seek external inputs in uncertainties. We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr":

Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.\n  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.\n  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar \"winning margin\" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.\n  Agentic flows also enable \"post-silicon hyperspecialization\" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.\n  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of \"simulator escapes\", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u800c\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u6377\u5f84\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u7763\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u68c0\u6d4b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u68c0\u9a8c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5426\u652f\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u9ad8\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u975e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u7f13\u89e3\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5141\u8bb8\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u793a\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u6377\u5f84\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

STOEP consists of three key components: (1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL), which dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using historical infection patterns; (2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE), which employs learnable spatial priors to amplify weak epidemic signals; and (3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF), which uses an expert-guided adaptive thresholding strategy to regularize epidemic parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world COVID-19 and influenza datasets demonstrate that STOEP outperforms the best baseline by 11.1% in RMSE.

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Benchmark and evaluation code will be publicly released", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality.

Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86AI-LCA\u878d\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u4e9b\u5e74AI\u4e0eLCA\u878d\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0eLLM\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LCA\u7814\u7a76\u4e2dAI\u6280\u672f\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u660e\u663e\u4e0a\u5347\uff0cAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94LCA\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027", "conclusion": "LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eLCA\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf"}}

Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence.

Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too complex for practical use. Thus, we propose \\textbf{OmniZip}, \\textbf{a unified and lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data (like image, text, speech, tactile, database, and gene sequence)}. Built on a lightweight backbone, OmniZip incorporates three key components to enable efficient multi-modal lossless compression: a modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, a modality-routing context learning mechanism that enables flexible multi-modal context modeling, and a modality-routing feedforward design that further enhances the model's nonlinear representation flexibility. A reparameterization training strategy is used to enhance model capacity.

The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aO-RAN\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u56fe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u7528\u6237\u6743\u91cd\u3001O-RU\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u91c7\u7528PEFT\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5de5\u4f5c\u7531\u72ec\u7acb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u5f00\u653e\u7684O-RAN\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fd0\u8425\u610f\u56fe\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u6743\u91cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u68c0\u7d22\u7ecf\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u7528\u6237\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u82e5\u6d89\u53ca\u8282\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5219O-RU\u7ba1\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528DRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9aO-RU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u76d1\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6700\u5c0f\u901f\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u91c7\u7528PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u540c\u4e00\u57fa\u7840LLM\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8282\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6d3b\u8dc3O-RU\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8641.93%\u3002\u4f7f\u7528PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u90e8\u7f72\u72ec\u7acbLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8692%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aO-RAN\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a \"ColdStart\" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training.

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

An Energy-Based Theory and Regularizer for Concept Drift in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals", "comment": null, "summary": "Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.\n  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift.

As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics.

We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from \"Know What You Know\" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers.

We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes.

To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \\cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients.

Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models.

Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound.

Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures.

This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters.

In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\\hat\u03b3 \\approx \u03b3$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model.

Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling.

For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content.

Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality.

This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $\u03c6$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $\u03c6$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $\u03c6$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning.

This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.\n  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.\n  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability.

Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD.

In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance.

To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures.

For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.\n  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods.

However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures.

Continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are costly and brittle, whereas neural memory methods promise lightweight updates with minimal forgetting. However, existing neural memory models typically assume a single fixed objective and homogeneous information streams, leaving users with no control over what the model remembers or ignores over time. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language. Our approach enables adaptive agents to learn selectively from heterogeneous information sources, supporting settings, such as healthcare and customer service, where fixed-objective memory updates are insufficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold. Experimental results on seven public datasets for both classification and regression demonstrate that FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing the smallest prediction sets or intervals.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, establishing a reliable generalization measure for statistically singular models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) is difficult due to their complex nature. This study focuses on Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) to investigate the conditions under which this classical measure can effectively explain the generalization gaps of DNNs. Importantly, the developed theory indicates the applicability of TIC near the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In a series of experiments, we trained more than 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures, including large models (e.g., VGG-16), on four datasets, and estimated the corresponding TIC values to examine the relationship between the generalization gap and the TIC estimates. We applied several TIC approximation methods with feasible computational costs and assessed the accuracy trade-off. Our experimental results indicate that the estimated TIC values correlate well with the generalization gap under conditions close to the NTK regime. However, we show both theoretically and empirically that outside the NTK regime such correlation disappears. Finally, we demonstrate that TIC provides better trial pruning ability than existing methods for hyperparameter optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients.

We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space.

We would like to be able to drive disagreement to zero with some natural parameter(s) of the training procedure using analyses that can be applied to existing training methodologies.\n  We develop a simple general technique for proving bounds on independent model disagreement based on $\\textit{anchoring}$ to the average of two models within the analysis.

Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest.

Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology.

Building on this module, we propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory.

In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload.
