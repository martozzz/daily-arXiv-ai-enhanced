While prior work has focused heavily on agent fine-tuning, tool interfaces-including natural language descriptions and parameter schemas-remain largely human-oriented and often become a bottleneck, especially when agents must select from large candidate tool sets. Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely on execution traces, which are frequently unavailable in cold-start or privacy-constrained settings, and typically optimize each tool independently, limiting scalability and generalization to unseen tools. We propose Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework that progressively transfers supervision from trace-rich settings to trace-free deployment, encouraging the model to abstract reusable interface-usage patterns and tool usage outcomes. To support this approach, we construct a large-scale dataset of high-quality tool interfaces using a structured workflow over a diverse collection of tools. Experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench show consistent gains on unseen tools, strong cross-domain generalization, and robustness as the number of candidate tools scales to over 100, demonstrating that tool interface optimization is a practical and deployable complement to agent fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework to optimize tool interfaces for LLM agents, reducing reliance on execution traces and improving scalability and generalization.", "motivation": "LLM-based agent performance depends on tool interface quality.

Such a capability could help researchers identify collaborators and impactful research directions, and anticipate which problems and methods will become central next. We introduce PreScience -- a scientific forecasting benchmark that decomposes the research process into four interdependent generative tasks: collaborator prediction, prior work selection, contribution generation, and impact prediction. PreScience is a carefully curated dataset of 98K recent AI-related research papers, featuring disambiguated author identities, temporally aligned scholarly metadata, and a structured graph of companion author publication histories and citations spanning 502K total papers. We develop baselines and evaluations for each task, including LACERScore, a novel LLM-based measure of contribution similarity that outperforms previous metrics and approximates inter-annotator agreement. We find substantial headroom remains in each task -- e.g. in contribution generation, frontier LLMs achieve only moderate similarity to the ground-truth (GPT-5, averages 5.6 on a 1-10 scale).

Coupled-cluster (CC) theory is the most successful method for achieving accuracy beyond DFT and for predicting properties that closely align with experiment. It is known as the ''gold standard'' of quantum chemistry. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of CC limits its widespread applicability. In this work, we present the Molecular Orbital Learning (M\u014dLe) architecture, an equivariant machine learning model that directly predicts CC's core mathematical objects, the excitation amplitudes, from the mean-field Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals as inputs.

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations.

We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies.

Existing methods rely on rigid templates that simply concatenate fields, yielding suboptimal representations for recommendation. We propose a data-centric framework that learns verbalization for LLM-based recommendation. Using reinforcement learning, a verbalization agent transforms raw interaction histories into optimized textual contexts, with recommendation accuracy as the training signal. This agent learns to filter noise, incorporate relevant metadata, and reorganize information to improve downstream predictions. Experiments on a large-scale industrial streaming dataset show that learned verbalization delivers up to 93% relative improvement in discovery item recommendation accuracy over template-based baselines. Further analysis reveals emergent strategies such as user interest summarization, noise removal, and syntax normalization, offering insights into effective context construction for LLM-based recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u672c\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4f18\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6a21\u677f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u9ad8\u8fbe93%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u521a\u6027\u6a21\u677f\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u5316\uff08\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u65e5\u5fd7\u8f6c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u8be5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee5\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6574\u5408\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6a21\u677f\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u7269\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8fbe93%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d8c\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5982\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u603b\u7ed3\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u53bb\u9664\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u603b\u7ed3\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u8303\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We introduce CausalReasoningBenchmark, a benchmark of 173 queries across 138 real-world datasets, curated from 85 peer-reviewed research papers and four widely-used causal-inference textbooks. For each query a system must produce (i) a structured identification specification that names the strategy, the treatment, outcome, and control variables, and all design-specific elements, and (ii) a point estimate with a standard error. By scoring these two components separately, our benchmark enables granular diagnosis: it distinguishes failures in causal reasoning from errors in numerical execution. Baseline results with a state-of-the-art LLM show that, while the model correctly identifies the high-level strategy in 84 % of cases, full identification-specification correctness drops to only 30 %, revealing that the bottleneck lies in the nuanced details of research design rather than in computation.

Surrogate models can accelerate simulations, but generalization across diverse anatomies is challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. We propose a two-step framework that decouples geometric representation from learning the physics response, to enable shape-informed surrogate modeling under data-scarce conditions. First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds.

A safety case sketch across collusion strategies", "comment": "66 pages, 14 figures, Preprint", "summary": "AIs are increasingly being deployed with greater autonomy and capabilities, which increases the risk that a misaligned AI may be able to cause catastrophic harm. Untrusted monitoring -- using one untrusted model to oversee another -- is one approach to reducing risk. Justifying the safety of an untrusted monitoring deployment is challenging because developers cannot safely deploy a misaligned model to test their protocol directly. In this paper, we develop upon existing methods for rigorously demonstrating safety based on pre-deployment testing. We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring. We develop a taxonomy covering passive self-recognition, causal collusion (hiding pre-shared signals), acausal collusion (hiding signals via Schelling points), and combined strategies.

QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our analysis reveals that reasoning manifests as a transient geometric pulse, where concept manifolds are untangled into linearly separable subspaces immediately prior to computation and rapidly compressed thereafter. This behavior diverges from standard linear probe accuracy, which remains high long after computation, suggesting a fundamental distinction between information that is merely retrievable and information that is geometrically prepared for processing.

To address these limitations, we present NativeEmbodied, a challenging benchmark for VLM-driven embodied agents that uses a unified, native low-level action space.

For more detailed analysis, we further decouple the skills required by complex tasks and construct four types of low-level tasks, each targeting a fundamental embodied skill. This joint evaluation across task and skill granularities enables fine-grained assessment of embodied agents.

In this work, we introduce Polarity-Prompt Contrastive Decoding (PromptCD), a test-time behavior control method that generalizes contrastive decoding to broader enhancement settings. PromptCD constructs paired positive and negative guiding prompts for a target behavior and contrasts model responses-specifically token-level probability distributions in LLMs and visual attention patterns in VLMs-to reinforce desirable outcomes. This formulation extends contrastive decoding to a wide range of enhancement objectives and is applicable to both LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without additional training. For LLMs, experiments on the \"3H\" alignment objectives (helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements, indicating that post-trained models can achieve meaningful self-enhancement purely at test time. For VLMs, we further analyze contrastive effects on visual attention, showing that PromptCD significantly improves VQA performance by reinforcing behavior-consistent visual grounding.

It matches the effect of standard guidance without extra computation and can further improve quality when combined with CFG. Experiments demonstrate MG's effectiveness across benchmarks.

This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $\u03b2$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $\u03b2= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $\u03b2= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $\u03b2$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.\n  We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST. These results suggest that CST can improve CoT faithfulness in general, with promising applications for CoT monitoring.

However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal.

However, a fundamental assumption behind pruning is that expendable weights should have small impact on the error of the network, while highly important weights should tend to have a larger influence on the inference. We argue that this idea could be generalized; what if a weight is not simply removed but also compensated with a perturbation of the adjacent bias, which does not contribute to the network sparsity?

Current approaches, however, often neglect the valence consistency and structured correlations inherent among coexisting emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a Memory-guided Prototypical Co-occurrence Learning (MPCL) framework that explicitly models emotion co-occurrence patterns. Specifically, we first fuse multi-modal signals via a multi-scale associative memory mechanism. To capture cross-modal semantic relationships, we construct emotion-specific prototype memory banks, yielding rich physiological and behavioral representations, and employ prototype relation distillation to ensure cross-modal alignment in the latent prototype space. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive memory systems, we introduce a memory retrieval strategy to extract semantic-level co-occurrence associations across emotion categories. Through this bottom-up hierarchical abstraction process, our model learns affectively informative representations for accurate emotion distribution prediction.

Specifically, GenSR first pretrains a dual-branch Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to reparameterize symbolic equations into a generative latent space with symbolic continuity and local numerical smoothness. This space can be regarded as a well-structured `map'' of the equation space, providing directional signals for search. At inference, the CVAE coarsely localizes the input data to promising regions in the latent space. Then, a modified CMA-ES refines the candidate region, leveraging smooth latent gradients. From a Bayesian perspective, GenSR reframes the SR task as maximizing the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{Equ.} \\mid \\mathrm{Num.})$, with CVAE training achieving this objective through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

A Feature-Based Triggerless Backdoor Attack in Vertical Federated Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "As a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm, vertical federated learning (VFL) allows multiple passive parties with distinct features and one active party with labels to collaboratively train a model. Although it is known for the privacy-preserving capabilities, VFL still faces significant privacy and security threats from backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks typically involve an attacker implanting a trigger into the model during the training phase and executing the attack by adding the trigger to the samples during the inference phase. However, in this paper, we find that triggers are not essential for backdoor attacks in VFL. In light of this, we disclose a new backdoor attack pathway in VFL by introducing a feature-based triggerless backdoor attack. This attack operates under a more stringent security assumption, where the attacker is honest-but-curious rather than malicious during the training phase. It comprises three modules: label inference for the targeted backdoor attack, poison generation with amplification and perturbation mechanisms, and backdoor execution to implement the attack. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms three baseline backdoor attacks by 2 to 50 times while minimally impacting the main task. Even in VFL scenarios with 32 passive parties and only one set of auxiliary data, our attack maintains high performance. Moreover, when confronted with distinct defense strategies, our attack remains largely unaffected and exhibits strong robustness. We hope that the disclosure of this triggerless backdoor attack pathway will encourage the community to revisit security threats in VFL scenarios and inspire researchers to develop more robust and practical defense strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations. Finally, addressing dynamics via architecture scaling, we propose UrbanFM, a minimalist self-attention architecture designed with limited inductive biases to autonomously learn dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from massive data.

Surrogate models can accelerate hydraulic-structure design, but progress is limited by scarce large, well-documented datasets that jointly capture geometric variation, operating conditions, and functional performance. This study presents WeirNet, a large 3D CFD benchmark dataset for geometric surrogate modeling of PKWs. WeirNet contains 3,794 parametric, feasibility-constrained rectangular and trapezoidal PKW geometries, each scheduled at 19 discharge conditions using a consistent free-surface OpenFOAM workflow, resulting in 71,387 completed simulations that form the benchmark and with complete discharge coefficient labels. The dataset is released as multiple modalities compact parametric descriptors, watertight surface meshes and high-resolution point clouds together with standardized tasks and in-distribution and out-of-distribution splits. Representative surrogate families are benchmarked for discharge coefficient prediction. Tree-based regressors on parametric descriptors achieve the best overall accuracy, while point- and mesh-based models remain competitive and offer parameterization-agnostic inference. All surrogates evaluate in milliseconds per sample, providing orders-of-magnitude speedups over CFD runtimes. Out-of-distribution results identify geometry shift as the dominant failure mode compared to unseen discharge values, and data-efficiency experiments show diminishing returns beyond roughly 60% of the training data. By publicly releasing the dataset together with simulation setups and evaluation pipelines, WeirNet establishes a reproducible framework for data-driven hydraulic modeling and enables faster exploration of PKW designs during the early stages of hydraulic planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Energy Demand Forecasting (EDF) of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) is one of the most critical operations for ensuring efficient energy management and sustainability, since it enables utility providers to anticipate energy/power demand, optimize resource allocation, and implement proactive measures to improve grid reliability. However, accurate EDF is a challenging problem due to external factors, such as the varying user routines, weather conditions, driving behaviors, unknown state of charge, etc. Furthermore, as concerns and restrictions about privacy and sustainability have grown, training data has become increasingly fragmented, resulting in distributed datasets scattered across different data silos and/or edge devices, calling for federated learning solutions. In this paper, we investigate different well-established time series forecasting methodologies to address the EDF problem, from statistical methods (the ARIMA family) to traditional machine learning models (such as XGBoost) and deep neural networks (GRU and LSTM). We provide an overview of these methods through a performance comparison over four real-world EVSE datasets, evaluated under both centralized and federated learning paradigms, focusing on the trade-offs between forecasting fidelity, privacy preservation, and energy overheads.

Our results uncover several intriguing and counterintuitive findings. First, rehearsal can impair model's adaptability, in sharp contrast to its traditionally recognized benefits. Second, increasing the rehearsal scale does not necessarily improve memory retention. When tasks are similar and noise levels are low, the memory error exhibits a diminishing lower bound.

In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions.

However, standard approaches often struggle with noisy interactions, and conventional post-hoc attribution methods may lack reliability, potentially highlighting dataset-specific artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIME, an interpretable framework that bridges intrinsic interpretability with minimal-sufficient subgraph optimization by integrating prototype-based classification and consistency training with structural perturbations during learning. This encourages a structured latent space and enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) under a prototype-consistent objective to extract compact minimal-sufficient explanatory subgraphs post-training. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that PIME achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by constraining the search space via learned prototypes, PIME identifies critical brain regions that are consistent with established neuroimaging findings. Stability analysis shows 90% reproducibility and consistent explanations across atlases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their scalability is hindered by significant computational and memory demands, especially for large-scale models with many parameters. This study aims to leverage DeepSpeed, a highly efficient distributed training framework that is commonly used for language models, to enhance the scalability and performance of ViTs. We evaluate intra- and inter-node training efficiency across multiple GPU configurations on various datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, exploring the impact of distributed data parallelism on training speed, communication overhead, and overall scalability (strong and weak scaling). By systematically varying software parameters, such as batch size and gradient accumulation, we identify key factors influencing performance of distributed training. The experiments in this study provide a foundational basis for applying DeepSpeed to image-related tasks. Future work will extend these investigations to deepen our understanding of DeepSpeed's limitations and explore strategies for optimizing distributed training pipelines for Vision Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} < o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.\n  We complement this upper bound with a variety of lower bounds showing that it is essentially tight: not only can the consistency/robustness tradeoff not be improved, but our particular loss function cannot be meaningfully improved.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce SOM-VQ, a tokenization method that combines vector quantization with Self-Organizing Maps to learn discrete codebooks with explicit low-dimensional topology. Unlike standard VQ-VAE, SOM-VQ uses topology-aware updates that preserve neighborhood structure: nearby tokens on a learned grid correspond to semantically similar states, enabling direct geometric manipulation of the latent space. We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints. We focus on human motion generation - a domain where kinematic structure, smooth temporal continuity, and interactive use cases (choreography, rehabilitation, HCI) make topology-aware control especially natural - demonstrating controlled divergence and convergence from reference sequences through simple grid-based sampling. SOM-VQ provides a general framework for interpretable discrete representations applicable to music, gesture, and other interactive generative domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce the Sequential Counterfactual Framework, which respects temporal dependencies in electronic health records by distinguishing immutable features (chronic diagnoses) from controllable features (lab values) and modeling how interventions propagate through time. Applied to 2,723 COVID-19 patients (383 Long COVID heart failure cases, 2,340 matched controls), we demonstrate that 38-67% of patients with chronic conditions would require biologically impossible counterfactuals under naive methods. We identify a cardiorenal cascade (CKD -> AKI -> HF) with relative risks of 2.27 and 1.19 at each step, illustrating temporal propagation that sequential -- but not naive -- counterfactuals can capture. Our framework transforms counterfactual explanation from \"what if this feature were different?\" to \"what if we had intervened earlier, and how would that propagate forward?\" --  yielding clinically actionable insights grounded in biological plausibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their sampling quality plateaus with ancestral samplers as the number of steps increases. We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that generalize prior methods and apply to arbitrary noise processes. When paired with uniform-state diffusion, our samplers outperform ancestral sampling on both language and image modeling, achieving lower generative perplexity at matched unigram entropy on OpenWebText and better FID/IS scores on CIFAR10. Crucially, unlike conventional samplers, our PC methods continue to improve with more sampling steps. Taken together, these findings call into question the assumption that Masked diffusion is the inevitable future of diffusion-based language modeling. Beyond sampling, we develop a memory-efficient curriculum for the Gaussian relaxation training phase, reducing training time by 25% and memory by 33% compared to Duo while maintaining comparable perplexity on OpenWebText and LM1B and strong downstream performance.

Kane"], "title": "Statistical Query Lower Bounds for Smoothed Agnostic Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the complexity of smoothed agnostic learning, recently introduced by~\\cite{CKKMS24}, in which the learner competes with the best classifier in a target class under slight Gaussian perturbations of the inputs. Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\\tilde{O}(1/\u03c3^2) \\log(1/\u03b5)}$, where $\u03c3$ is the smoothing parameter and $\u03b5$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{\u03a9(1/\u03c3^{2}+\\log(1/\u03b5))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
