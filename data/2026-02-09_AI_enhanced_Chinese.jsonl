Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \\sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faJackpot\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling\uff08OBRS\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08rollout\uff09\u8017\u65f6\u3002\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJackpot\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528OBRS\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u504f\u7f6e\u6821\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "OBRS\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aJackpot\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9eRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "OBRS\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities.

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks.

This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "NanoNet \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6574\u5408\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u573a\u666f\uff08\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa NanoNet \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "NanoNet \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "NanoNet \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness.

This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_\u03b8$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts. An agentic forecasting layer is proposed, in which specialised workflows are selected dynamically based on operational context.

DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling.

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.\n  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures.

In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoP \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bfb\u627e\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "MoP\uff08Mixture of Pruners\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u5019\u9009\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u526a\u679d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "MoP \u5728 LLaMA-2 \u548c LLaMA-3 \u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 40% \u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 39% \u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMoP \u8fd8\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b LLaVA-1.5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MoP \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64.

SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling.

This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner.

Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyPER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55-\u7f29\u51cf\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u63a2\u7d22-\u5f00\u53d1\u6743\u8861\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "method": "HyPER\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u63a2\u7d22\u5230\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6e21\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHyPER\u5728\u51cf\u5c1125%\u81f340%\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868%\u81f310%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HyPER\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55-\u7f29\u51cf\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives.

Under these assumptions it also follows that there is a solution to the projected Bellman equation (PBE). Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.\n  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.\n  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis.

This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives.

However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.\n  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.\n  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.\n  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSeeUPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709RL\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "SeeUPO\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u7684\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u9010\u8f6e\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSeeUPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe24.1%-54.6%\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SeeUPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u5f52\u7eb3\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002"}}

We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries.

Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases.

While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($\u03bc$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the \"optimal\" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $\u03bc$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($\u03bc$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting \"safe\" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules.

As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $\u03c1= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%.

We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks.

However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $\u03a9(\\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.\n  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \\log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \\log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$.

Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers.

As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model.

As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality.

Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes.

Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model.

These abstractions enable property verification by encoding the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), determining whether outputs satisfy specified properties when inputs belong to a given set. A critical challenge lies in balancing the number of pieces in the PWA approximation: too many pieces add binary variables that make verification computationally intractable, while too few pieces create excessive error margins that yield uninformative bounds. Our key contribution is a systematic framework that exploits KAN structure to find optimal abstractions. By combining dynamic programming at the unit level with a knapsack optimization across the network, we minimize the total number of pieces while guaranteeing specified error bounds.

To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies. Extensive experiments in the zero-shot setting demonstrate that GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines, and even surpasses strong competitors that are few-shot fine-tuned with labeled data from the target domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B.

Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $\u03bb$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings.

We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection.

Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\\sum_t \u03bb_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $\u03bb_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability.

In real world settings, the subpopulations most affected by such disparities are frequently unlabeled or unknown, thereby motivating the development of methods that are performant on sensitive subgroups without being pre-specified. However, existing group-robust methods typically assume prior knowledge of relevant subgroups, using group annotations for training or model selection. We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance. Across all settings, LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while remaining fast, parameter-efficient, and robust to hyperparameter choice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error.

We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.\n  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics.
