Abstract: The rapid growth of cloud computing in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has created a critical need for resource and job lifetime prediction to achieve optimal scheduling. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads, requiring extensive feature engineering and domain expertise. We propose a novel framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this challenge through text-to-text regression. We introduce the scientific notation and prefix filling to constrain the LLM, significantly improving output format reliability. Moreover, we found that full-attention finetuning and inference improves the prediction accuracy of sliding-window-attention LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on real-world cloud datasets, setting a new baseline for performance prediction in the EDA domain.

*Taoran Sheng,Manfred Huber*

TL;DR: The paper explores various learning paradigms for HAR, proposing a novel weakly self-supervised framework that achieves high accuracy with minimal labeled data, offering practical solutions for limited-label scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements in human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors, aiming to minimize labeling needs while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Method: The paper develops and compares six approaches: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) weakly supervised learning with constraints, (4) multi-task learning with knowledge sharing, (5) self-supervised learning based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework.

Result: Experiments show that weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches with reduced supervision, the multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing, and the weakly self-supervised approach is efficient with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the novel weakly self-supervised learning framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited, highlighting the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

*Behrooz Mamandipoor,Chun-Nan Hsu,Martin Krause,Ulrich H. Schmidt,Rodney A. Gabriel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning model using structured and unstructured data predicts in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with high accuracy, validated across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality can optimize treatment for critically ill patients, necessitating a reliable model that leverages comprehensive clinical data.

Method: A multimodal deep learning model was developed using structured (time-invariant and time-variant variables) and unstructured (clinical notes, chest X-ray images) data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID datasets, focusing on the first 24 hours of ICU admission.

Result: The model achieved high performance (AUROC: 0.92, AUPRC: 0.53, Brier score: 0.19) and improved further with clinical notes and imaging (AUROC: 0.89, AUPRC: 0.48, Brier score: 0.17), validated across multiple institutions.

Conclusion: The study underscores the value of integrating multimodal data (structured and unstructured) for accurate in-hospital mortality prediction in critically ill patients, with external validation confirming the model's robustness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

Result: ICFA在约束语言生成和稀疏奖励导航两个实验中表现良好，并通过结构化提示展示了近似ICFA的语言级形式。

Conclusion: ICFA提供了一种实用的框架，通过目标条件重加权过程在大规模候选空间中寻找稀有但有用的解决方案，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

Motivation: To address the fragmented and incomplete evaluation practices of synthetic data in AI, which hinder innovation and data accessibility.

Method: SDB is a modular Python-based library that includes automated feature-type detection, fidelity metrics (distributional and dependency-level), structure preservation scores (graph- and embedding-based), and data visualization tools.

Result: SDB demonstrated robustness and domain-agnostic applicability across three real-world use cases: healthcare diagnostics, socioeconomic/financial modeling, and cybersecurity/network traffic analysis.

Conclusion: Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB) provides a consistent, transparent, and reproducible framework for assessing synthetic data fidelity across diverse domains, addressing the current fragmented evaluation practices.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MDFA-Net for efficient RUL prediction, combining shallow and deep feature networks to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modeling techniques for battery degradation sequences are inefficient and inadequate for real-life applications.

Method: Proposes MDFA-Net, a dual-path network combining MF-Net for shallow information and EC-Net for deep details.

Result: Testing on Lithium-ion battery datasets shows MDFA-Net outperforms top-tier methods in RUL prediction.

Conclusion: MDFA-Net surpasses existing methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping battery degradation trajectories.

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

### [7] [Per-Axis Weight Deltas for Frequent Model Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19720)
*Stefan Kuyumdzhiev,Radostin Cholakov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 1-bit delta compression method for fine-tuned LLM weights reduces storage and latency while maintaining efficiency, using sign and per-axis scaling factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large fine-tuned checkpoints and cold-start latency by leveraging the small structured residuals between fine-tuned weights and their base model.

Method: The method involves representing fine-tuned weights as compressed deltas, storing only the sign of the weight difference with lightweight per-axis FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set.

Result: The design preserves compactness, improves reconstruction quality, reduces cold-start latency, and significantly decreases storage overhead compared to full FP16 checkpoints.

Conclusion: The proposed 1-bit delta scheme effectively reduces storage and cold-start latency while maintaining inference efficiency, making it a practical solution for serving many task-specialized LLM variants.

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction. Our experimental setup and source code are available at https://github.com/kuiumdjiev/Per-Axis-Weight-Deltas-for-Frequent-Model-Updates.

### [8] [Sign-Aware Multistate Jaccard Kernels and Geometry for Real and Complex-Valued Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19721)
*Vineet Yadav*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sign-aware Jaccard/Tanimoto framework extends overlap-based distances to real/complex signals, maintaining metric and kernel properties, with applications in scientific and financial analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend overlap-based distances to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining desirable mathematical properties, enabling broader applications in scientific and financial analysis.

Method: The method involves representing signals as atomic measures on a signed state space, using positive/negative splits for real signals and Cartesian/polar decompositions for complex signals. It applies the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings to produce a family of distances.

Result: The framework yields bounded metric distances and positive-semidefinite kernels, supporting applications like correlograms, feature engineering, and similarity graphs. It also provides coalition analysis and probabilistic semantics.

Conclusion: The paper presents a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances to real- and complex-valued signals, maintaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel properties. It offers a unified approach for various analytical applications.

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

*Srishti Gupta,Riccardo Balia,Daniele Angioni,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Ambra Demontis,Alessandro Sebastian,Salvatore Mario Carta,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Traditional machine learning struggles with evolving data; Continual Learning and OOD detection are proposed to improve adaptability and robustness in dynamic real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges faced by machine learning models in real-world, dynamic environments where data distribution changes over time and novel inputs frequently occur.

Method: The paper discusses the limitations of traditional machine learning models under the i.i.d. assumption and proposes the integration of CL and OOD detection as solutions.

Result: The paper highlights the potential of CL and OOD detection to enhance model reliability and adaptability in non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the necessity of Continual Learning (CL) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to develop robust and adaptive AI systems that can handle evolving data and novel conditions effectively.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

*Carlos Purves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A split-policy architecture reduces edge device deployment challenges by using a compact on-device encoder, lowering latency and data transmission while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices, such as computational cost and communication latency.

Method: Implemented a small on-device encoder as OpenGL fragment-shader passes to transform observations into compact feature tensors for transmission to a remote policy head.

Result: The approach reduces data transmission and decision latency, with modest trade-offs in mean return, while maintaining comparable learning performance.

Conclusion: The split-policy architecture effectively reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency, and decreases server-side compute, with comparable learning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

*Peng-Hung Tsai,Daniel Berleant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid LSTM and Moore's law model, enhanced by STETI, to accurately forecast spacecraft lifetimes, overcoming biases in traditional methods for better space mission planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of traditional quantitative trend extrapolation techniques in forecasting technological advancements in space exploration, particularly the bias introduced by right censoring in spacecraft lifetime data.

Method: The method involves a hybrid model combining LSTM neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law, utilizing the STETI approach to mitigate right censoring bias in lifetime data.

Result: The results demonstrate that the hybrid model effectively predicts spacecraft lifetimes, offering more accurate insights for mission planning and policy decisions by addressing the right censoring issue.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining LSTM neural networks with an augmented Moore's law provides a robust method for forecasting spacecraft lifetimes, addressing biases in traditional methods through the STETI approach. This has significant implications for space mission planning and policy.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

### [14] [Hard Negative Sample-Augmented DPO Post-Training for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19728)
*Haocheng Lu,Minjun Zhu,Henry Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight post-training pipeline using a MathVerifier and weighted DPO targets structured errors in LLM mathematical reasoning, outperforming traditional methods without heavy computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with mathematical reasoning, and existing post-training pipelines often reduce solutions to binary outcomes, missing structured errors. Current RLHF variants are expensive and unstable.

Method: The method involves supervised fine-tuning on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, introducing a MathVerifier to decompose solutions into error profiles, and integrating verifier signals into an offline DPO objective.

Result: Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO improves performance on near-correct but logically inconsistent solutions more effectively than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight post-training pipeline, incorporating a compact MathVerifier and verifier-guided weighted DPO, effectively targets structured errors in mathematical reasoning without the overhead of large reward models or external judges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowFM combines representation learning and flow matching for efficient, high-quality generation and recognition, outperforming diffusion models in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance in diffusion models, and reduce computational and energy costs for industrial and edge AI applications.

Method: The paper proposes FlowFM, which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator, using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field.

Result: FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4%, surpasses state-of-the-art SSL methods on downstream tasks, and achieves up to a 51.0x inference speedup.

Conclusion: FlowFM demonstrates a significant improvement in both generative quality and discriminative performance, achieving faster training and inference speeds while maintaining high fidelity.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning.

Motivation: Existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods fail to generalize to new architectures, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: The proposed method, ArcGen, introduces an alignment layer in the feature extraction function and uses two alignment losses to train the function, ensuring features are architecture-invariant.

Result: ArcGen shows up to 42.5% improvement in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen architectures, validated by large-scale evaluations.

Conclusion: ArcGen demonstrates significant improvements in backdoor detection performance on unseen model architectures, achieving up to 42.5% better detection rates.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

TL;DR: Double-Win NAS transforms deep networks into shallow ones for better hardware efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, validated on embedded systems and large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the dilemma between deep networks' high accuracy but poor hardware efficiency and shallow networks' superior hardware efficiency but inferior accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces Double-Win NAS, a deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search paradigm, enhanced by hybrid transformable training and arbitrary-resolution elastic training techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, ImageNet, and ImageNet-100 demonstrate Double-Win NAS's superiority over previous NAS approaches.

Conclusion: Double-Win NAS successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and hardware efficiency by transforming deep networks into shallow counterparts, achieving superior performance on resource-constrained embedded systems.

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Abstract: The structure of topology underpins much of the research on performance and robustness, yet available topology data are typically scarce, necessitating the generation of synthetic graphs with desired properties for testing or release. Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been an active area of research, with applications ranging from healthcare to smart environments. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities to leverage their capabilities in HAR, enabling not just activity classification but also interpretability and human-like interaction. In this paper, we present a Large Multi-Modal Agent designed for HAR, which integrates the power of LLMs to enhance both performance and user engagement. The proposed framework not only delivers activity classification but also bridges the gap between technical outputs and user-friendly insights through its reasoning and question-answering capabilities. We conduct extensive evaluations using widely adopted HAR datasets, including HHAR, Shoaib, Motionsense to assess the performance of our framework. The results demonstrate that our model achieves high classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving interpretability through its reasoning and Q&A capabilities.

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel data-driven framework and the first-ever county-scale application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNN) to forecast composite sustainability indices from herd-level operational records. The methodology employs a novel, end-to-end pipeline utilizing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to augment Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) datasets, preserving joint distributions while mitigating sparsity. A first-ever pillar-based scoring formulation is derived via Principal Component Analysis, identifying Reproductive Efficiency, Genetic Management, Herd Health, and Herd Management, to construct weighted composite indices. These indices are modelled using a novel STGNN architecture that explicitly encodes geographic dependencies and non-linear temporal dynamics to generate multi-year forecasts for 2026-2030.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning across multi-cloud environments faces critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, malicious participant detection, and substantial cross-cloud communication costs (egress fees). Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

Abstract: We study offline multitask reinforcement learning in settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions. In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

*Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,F. Sibel Salman,Walter J. Gutjahr*

TL;DR: A bi-objective optimization approach balances efficiency and equity in disaster relief logistics, using MIP and B&P algorithms to reduce inequity by 34% without losing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing efficiency and equity in post-disaster relief supply distribution, especially when prepositioned supplies are insufficient.

Method: A Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model is proposed, using the $ε$-constraint method to handle bi-objective optimization. Valid inequalities and a branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm are developed for efficient solution.

Result: The B&P algorithm outperforms commercial MIP solvers, significantly reducing aid distribution inequity by 34%. Computational tests on real and predicted data validate the approach.

Conclusion: The bi-objective approach effectively balances efficiency and equity in relief supply distribution, reducing inequity by 34% without sacrificing efficiency. Lexicographic optimization is recommended for extreme time constraints, while a balanced approach is essential for moderate constraints.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

*Eric Yeh,John Cadigan,Ran Chen,Dick Crouch,Melinda Gervasio,Dayne Freitag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs use interpolative decoding to simulate human personality and decision-making, replicating psychological research findings efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the experimental overhead and replicability issues caused by creating individual prompts for each personality profile in LLM-based human behavior simulations.

Method: The research employs interpolative decoding, representing personality dimensions as pairs of opposed prompts and using an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along these dimensions.

Result: Interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along the Big Five personality dimensions and successfully mimics human decision-making in economic games, replicating human psychological research findings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that interpolative decoding effectively modulates personality traits in LLMs and replicates human decision-making behaviors in economic games, offering a scalable method for human behavior simulation.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Motivation: To address the fine-grained multi-label species identification challenge in the PlantCLEF 2025 competition by leveraging class prototypes for improved segmentation and classification.

Method: The approach uses class prototypes from the training dataset to guide a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT), which is trained to reconstruct these prototypes from test images. Features are extracted and clustered using K-Means, and a customized narrow ViT with a frozen DinoV2 patch embedding layer is employed.

Result: The method achieved an F1 score of 0.33331, ranking fifth in the challenge, and showed competitive performance with a slight margin below the top submission.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieved competitive performance in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge, ranking fifth with an F1 score of 0.33331, and demonstrated potential for domain adaptation in multi-label classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-class variability can hinder DL model learning, especially in underrepresented classes common in FGVC tasks. The paper aims to mitigate this by learning more fine-grained visual features.

Method: Proposes a novel method that leverages classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Applies clustering over each class individually to discover pseudo-labels encoding latent similarity between images, used in a hierarchical classification process.

Result: Initial experiments on PlantNet300k highlight key points for future work. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance despite some unoptimized components.

Conclusion: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset, though some components require further optimization. Future work is needed for more conclusive evidence of its effectiveness.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

TL;DR: S$^{3}$IT benchmark tests embodied social intelligence via seat-ordering tasks, revealing LLMs' spatial intelligence gaps but competence in text-cued conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations lack integration of social norms and physical constraints in embodied contexts, necessitating a new benchmark to assess agents' ability to trade off these constraints.

Method: The study introduces S$^{3}$IT, a benchmark for evaluating embodied social intelligence through a seat-ordering task in a 3D environment, involving LLM-driven NPCs with diverse identities and preferences.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with S$^{3}$IT, showing significant gaps in spatial intelligence but near human-level competence in conflict resolution with textual cues.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit deficiencies in spatial intelligence but show potential in resolving conflicts with explicit textual cues, highlighting the gap between current models and human-level embodied social intelligence.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

Motivation: 对称性对理解物理系统和提高机器学习性能及样本效率至关重要，但需要了解数据中的潜在对称性。本文旨在直接从数据中学习对称性。

Method: 提出了一种基于Lie群的流匹配方法（\lieflow），通过学习更大假设群上的分布来匹配数据中观察到的对称性。相对于先前工作，该方法更灵活且假设更少。

Result: 在2D和3D点云上的实验表明，该方法成功发现了离散群（包括通过复数域上的流匹配实现的反射）。同时，识别并解决了“最后一刻收敛”的挑战。

Conclusion: 该论文通过流匹配方法在Lie群上学习数据中的对称性，成功发现了离散群（如反射），并提出了一种新的插值方案以解决目标模式对称排列导致的“最后一刻收敛”问题。

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

Method: 引入Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF)框架，通过学习基于光流的潜在技能空间，将视频动态与机器人动作对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SOF在多任务和长时域设置中均能提升性能，验证了直接从原始视觉数据获取和组合技能的可行性。

Conclusion: SOF框架通过基于光流的中间表示学习潜在技能空间，实现了从视频中获取和组合技能的能力，显著提升了多任务和长时域设置下的性能。

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of quickly and accurately identifying disaster locations for efficient response and resource allocation in the face of increasing climate-related disasters.

Method: Combines probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework, featuring uncertainty quantification and localizability scores.

Result: Achieves high accuracy (0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and provides explainability via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores.

Conclusion: The ProbGLC approach demonstrates superior geolocalization accuracy and explainability, offering significant potential for enhancing rapid disaster response through generative cross-view methods.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

TL;DR: RL enhances content moderation by improving nuanced reasoning and data efficiency, scaling well with more data before saturating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of training large language models (LLMs) for expert-level content moderation in real-world settings, particularly under conditions of label sparsity, evolving policies, and the need for nuanced reasoning.

Method: The paper employs reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, testing various RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies, including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks, across three real-world moderation tasks.

Result: RL improves performance on complex policy-grounded reasoning tasks and achieves significantly higher data efficiency (up to 100x) than supervised fine-tuning, making it suitable for domains with scarce expert annotations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that reinforcement learning (RL) significantly enhances content moderation tasks, especially in scenarios requiring nuanced reasoning and where expert annotations are limited. RL shows sigmoid-like scaling behavior, improving with more data and optimization before saturating, and offers up to 100x higher data efficiency compared to supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing exposure bias and misaligned explanations in current clinical decision support systems using LLMs.

Method: A two-stage training framework (Stage-1: rationale generation; Stage-2: joint training on label prediction and rationale generation with scheduled sampling).

Result: Outperforms baselines in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity across medical datasets, showing robustness with LLM-generated rationales.

Conclusion: Reason2Decide demonstrates effectiveness in clinical decision support by improving predictive accuracy and rationale alignment, even with smaller models, reducing reliance on human annotations.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis lacks consideration of stock prices or market feedback, prompting the development of a market-aware framework for improved sentiment classification.

Method: An adaptive framework integrating LLMs with real-world stock market feedback, employing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline and a feedback-driven module, enhanced by a reinforcement learning agent trained using PPO.

Result: Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines show significant improvements in classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed system combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment, validating its potential for robust financial sentiment modeling.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.
