Forging Perceptual Robustness via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit perceptual fragility when confronted with visually complex scenes. This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness. We introduce \\textbf{AOT-SFT}, a large-scale adversarial dataset for bootstrapping MLLM robustness. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data. Our method orchestrates a co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM, where the Attacker generates a diverse and dynamic curriculum of image manipulations, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOT enhances the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs."}

We translated findings into a hybrid risk screening system integrating symptom relevance and temporal proximity, evaluated across 3-90 day windows through EHR-based simulations. Under conservative thresholds, intentionally designed to minimize false alerts, the screening system achieved high specificity (1.00) and prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value (1.00), with good sensitivity (0.72), an expected trade-off prioritizing precision, that was highest in 90-day window. Patient-reported language alone supported high-precision, low-burden early stroke risk detection, that could offer a valuable time window for clinical evaluation and intervention for high-risk individuals."}

A common solution is assigning weights to high-resolution geographic units for aggregation, but traditional models are limited by using only a single geospatial attribute. This paper presents an innovative method employing a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to address this issue. This method models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance the conventional Voronoi-based allocation method, allowing it to go beyond simply geographic proximity by incorporating essential geographic information.In addition, the self-supervised learning paradigm overcomes the lack of accurate ground-truth data. Experimental results demonstrate that applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, and physical plausibility, while increasing precision compared to traditional methods."}

Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy."}

However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base.

Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance.

Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon \\perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes. We further embed CCA into a broader framework termed Causal Compression Learning (CCL), which integrates graph structure learning, causal information compression, and policy optimization, with all theoretical guarantees formally proved and empirically validated on synthetic datasets."}

Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions."}

We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency.

However, existing non-BP approaches still face critical challenges in efficiency and scalability. Inspired by neural representations and dynamic mechanisms in the brain, we propose a perturbation-based approach called LOw-rank Cluster Orthogonal (LOCO) weight modification. We find that low-rank is an inherent property of perturbation-based algorithms. Under this condition, the orthogonality constraint limits the variance of the node perturbation (NP) gradient estimates and enhances the convergence efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, LOCO demonstrates the capability to locally train the deepest spiking neural networks to date (more than 10 layers), while exhibiting strong continual learning ability, improved convergence efficiency, and better task performance compared to other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms. Notably, LOCO requires only O(1) parallel time complexity for weight updates, which is significantly lower than that of BP methods. This offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance, real-time, and lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems."}

We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action."}

This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages.

A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality."}

We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points."}

To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty."}

We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.\n  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar \"winning margin\" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.\n  Agentic flows also enable \"post-silicon hyperspecialization\" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.\n  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI.

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior."}

To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\\% to +8.3\\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems."}

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone."}

We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality.

Furthermore, increasing sizes of data hinder the deployment of most models in real application environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network (PASTN) to effectively capture both temporal and spatial complexities in an end-to-end manner. PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models.

Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies.

Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process. MBT implements this via two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S, which synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R, which rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns. Experiments across multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that MBT consistently outperforms baselines, achieving notable gains on challenging benchmarks. By effectively eliminating reasoning collapse, MBT achieves higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption, demonstrating that internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning."}

Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI."}

Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too complex for practical use. Thus, we propose \\textbf{OmniZip}, \\textbf{a unified and lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data (like image, text, speech, tactile, database, and gene sequence)}. Built on a lightweight backbone, OmniZip incorporates three key components to enable efficient multi-modal lossless compression: a modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, a modality-routing context learning mechanism that enables flexible multi-modal context modeling, and a modality-routing feedforward design that further enhances the model's nonlinear representation flexibility. A reparameterization training strategy is used to enhance model capacity. OmniZip outperforms or matches other state-of-the-art compressors on multiple modalities, achieving 42\\%, 57\\%, 62\\% and 42\\%, 53\\% higher compression efficiency than gzip on CLIC-M, TouchandGo, enwik9, LibriSpeech, and WikiSQL datasets, respectively.

The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents."}

Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50.

By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks.

However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a \"ColdStart\" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training.

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.\n  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.\n  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals."}

In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques."}

However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings."}

In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance.

Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth.

Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks.

We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy.

Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside."}

However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable \"safety valve\". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \\textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune \"stability\" and \"sensitivity\" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning."}

As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure."}

Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.\n  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline."}

The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations."}

In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from \"Know What You Know\" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration."}

The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms."}

Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available."}

We ask whether they can compete, benchmarking models across 55 regression datasets organised by application domain.\n  We develop an anisotropic RBF network with data-driven centre placement and gradient-based width optimisation, a ridge-regularised Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and a smooth-tree hybrid (Chebyshev model tree); all three are released as scikit-learn-compatible packages. We benchmark these against tree ensembles, a pre-trained transformer, and standard baselines, evaluating accuracy alongside generalisation behaviour.\n  The transformer ranks first on accuracy across a majority of datasets, but its GPU dependence, inference latency, and dataset-size limits constrain deployment in the CPU-based settings common across applied science and industry. Among CPU-viable models, smooth models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but the former tend to exhibit tighter generalisation gaps. We recommend routinely including smooth-basis models in the candidate pool, particularly when downstream use benefits from tighter generalisation and gradually varying predictions."}

We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions."}

We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality."}

Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis.

Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \\cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution.

TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters.

Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels.

Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation.

Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation.

In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest."}

The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.\n  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance.

We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems."}

Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!"}

To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\\% for male players and 44\\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions.

Most existing approaches rely on distributional or structural invariance to uncover underlying causal dynamics, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. However, these assumptions often conflict with the complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. This motivates the need for methods that address fully dynamic causality, where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time. Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine."}

By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges.

We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings."}

Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the \"more tuning, worse performance\" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives."}

Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters.

Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\\hatγ \\approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models.

We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment.

Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress."}

Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\\times$ attention and 3.81$\\times$ end-to-end speedups."}

To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought.

Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs."}

However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines."}

This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok.

To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch.

We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models."}

A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details."}

Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged.

This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $φ$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $φ$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $φ$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $φ$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs."}

This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.\n  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.\n  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument."}

Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance."}

This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off."}

We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a \"translator\" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer.

To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear.

Notably, ContextRL enables the Qwen3-VL-8B model to achieve performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin while effectively mitigating reward hacking. Our in-depth analysis reveals the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy and document the widespread occurrence of reward hacking, offering valuable insights for future RLVR research."}

Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality."}

However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning."}

While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization."}

However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets."}

However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning. LEDA exhibits strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Remarkably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models."}

The optimization landscape is highly anisotropic, with loss reduction driven predominantly by progress along flat directions.

To address this limitation, we first establish a unified Riemannian Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework that elucidates how common adaptive algorithms operate synergistically: the preconditioner induces a Riemannian geometry that mitigates ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as a Riemannian damping term that promotes convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose LITE, a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M--1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms that LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes, providing a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training.

To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE). The decoder follows a cross-attention autoregressive design with a shared hurdle head that explicitly separates the forecasting task into two components: a binary classification component estimating the probability of a sale, and a conditional regression component, predicting the quantity given a sale. This structured separation enables the model to capture both occurrence and magnitude processes inherent to intermittent demand. Empirical results on the M5 benchmark and a large proprietary retail dataset show that Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability."}

Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings."}

As a main hurdle, training these DNNs separately for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will amount to excessive storage or communication overhead, which can not be maintained by small IoT devices. SNR Adaptive DJSCC (ADJSCC), has been proposed to train the DNNs once but feed the current SNR as part of the data to the channel-wise attention mechanism. We improve upon ADJSCC by a simultaneous utilization of doubly adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention modules at both transmitter and receiver. These modules dynamically adjust to varying channel conditions and spatial feature importance, enabling robust and efficient feature extraction and semantic information recovery. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed doubly adaptive DJSCC (DA-DJSCC) significantly improves upon ADJSCC in several performance criteria, while incurring a mild increase in complexity. These facts render DA-DJSCC a desirable choice for semantic communication in performance demanding but low-complexity IoT networks."}

Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions."}

PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models.

To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research."}

To address this limitation, we introduce a framework that maps discretized function observations -- at arbitrary resolution and on arbitrary grids -- into a fixed-dimensional vector space via an auto-encoding architecture. The encoder is a hypernetwork that maps coordinate-value pairs to the weight space of an implicit neural representation (INR), which serves as the decoder. Because INRs represent functions with very few parameters, this design yields compact representations that are decoupled from the sampling grid, while the hypernetwork amortizes weight prediction across the dataset. Clustering is then performed in this weight space using standard algorithms, making the approach agnostic to both the discretization and the choice of clustering method. By means of synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings, we demonstrate competitive clustering performance that is robust to changes in sampling resolution -- including generalization to resolutions not seen during training."}

Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50.

We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior."}

For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.\n  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation."}

Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings."}

Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies.

We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave.

To ensure interpretability and enable reliable counterfactual analysis, the researchers adopted a tabular data approach rather than modeling temporal dependencies directly. Given the imbalance between fouling and non-fouling cases, the ADASYN oversampling technique was applied to improve minority class representation. Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were tested, achieving balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at a 10% rebalancing rate. Results remained robust across different forecasting horizons. Notably, the tabular approach outperformed LSTM recurrent neural networks, suggesting that explicit temporal modeling was not necessary for strong predictive performance. Feature selection further reduced the model to five key variables, improving simplicity and interpretability with minimal loss of accuracy. A Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis was applied to the best-performing model, successfully identifying minimal input changes capable of reversing fouling predictions. Overall, the findings support the viability of interpretable machine learning models for predicting membrane fouling during CRRT.

This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods."}

As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure."}

The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations."}

Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth. These findings suggest that future weather models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance."}

They therefore need an expected probability of failure for a transformer before training starts. Our study of Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling (RKSP) provides such an estimate. From a single forward pass at initialization, RKSP extracts Koopman spectral features by applying whitened dynamic mode decomposition to layer-wise residual snapshots. Our central diagnostic, the near-unit spectral mass, quantifies the fraction of modes concentrated near the unit circle, which captures instability risk. For predicting divergence across extensive configurations, this estimator achieves an AUROC of 0.995, outperforming the best gradient baseline. We further make this diagnostic actionable through Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS), which reshapes spectra during training. We empirically validate that our method works in practice: RKSP predicts divergence at initialization, and when RKSP flags high risk, turning on KSS successfully prevents divergence. In the challenging high learning rate regime without normalization layers, KSS reduces the divergence rate from 66.7% to 12.5% and enables learning rates that are 50% to 150% higher.

We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality."}

Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \\cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|ρ|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation. Results show latent interaction graphs and entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention."}

When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation.

To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm.

Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a \"next-scale prediction\" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images.

In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural particle flow, which is an amortized inference framework. To construct the flow, we couple the log-homotopy trajectory of the prior to posterior density function with the continuity equation describing the density evolution. This derivation yields a governing partial differential equation (PDE), referred to as the master PDE. By embedding this PDE as a physical constraint into the loss function, we train a neural network to approximate the transport velocity field. This approach enables purely unsupervised training, eliminating the need for ground-truth posterior samples. We demonstrate that the neural parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, mitigating the numerical stiffness inherent to analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity.

The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments."}

This work introduces a physics-informed training framework that addresses these limitations by decomposing PDEs using operator splitting methods, training separate neural operators to learn individual non-linear physical operators while approximating linear operators with fixed finite-difference convolutions. This modular mixture-of-experts architecture enables generalisation to novel physical regimes by explicitly encoding the underlying operator structure. We formulate the modelling task as a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) where these learned operators constitute the right-hand side, enabling continuous-in-time predictions through standard ODE solvers and implicitly enforcing PDE constraints. Demonstrated on incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations, our approach achieves better convergence and superior performance when generalising to unseen physics. The method remains parameter-efficient, enabling temporal extrapolation beyond training horizons, and provides interpretable components whose behaviour can be verified against known physics."}

Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling.

However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines."}

A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function.

This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures.

Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy.

To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference.

We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples.

For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.\n  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization.

We introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space. We find that transformers trained on mixed-game data do not partition their capacity into isolated sub-models; instead, they converge on a mostly shared board-state representation that transfers causally across variants. Linear probes trained on one variant can intervene on another's internal state with effectiveness approaching that of matched probes. For isomorphic games with token remapping, representations are equivalent up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers.

To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs."}

In contrast, neural-based methods exhibit biases toward uniform numerical processing of features and smooth solutions, making it challenging for them to effectively leverage such patterns. We address this performance gap by using statistical-based feature processing techniques to identify features that are strongly correlated with the target once discretized. We further mitigate the bias of deep models for overly-smooth solutions, a bias that does not align with the inherent properties of the data, using Learned Fourier. We show that our proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts the performance of deep learning models and enables them to achieve a performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark."}

From a single forward pass at initialization, RKSP extracts Koopman spectral features by applying whitened dynamic mode decomposition to layer-wise residual snapshots. Our central diagnostic, the near-unit spectral mass, quantifies the fraction of modes concentrated near the unit circle, which captures instability risk. For predicting divergence across extensive configurations, this estimator achieves an AUROC of 0.995, outperforming the best gradient baseline. We further make this diagnostic actionable through Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS), which reshapes spectra during training. We empirically validate that our method works in practice: RKSP predicts divergence at initialization, and when RKSP flags high risk, turning on KSS successfully prevents divergence.

The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics. Consequently, retraining can be limited to the autoencoder, allowing for a lightweight, computationally efficient, real-time adaptation procedure with very sparse fine-tuning data."}

A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods."}

Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning."}

This study focuses on Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) to investigate the conditions under which this classical measure can effectively explain the generalization gaps of DNNs. Importantly, the developed theory indicates the applicability of TIC near the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In a series of experiments, we trained more than 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures, including large models (e.g., VGG-16), on four datasets, and estimated the corresponding TIC values to examine the relationship between the generalization gap and the TIC estimates. We applied several TIC approximation methods with feasible computational costs and assessed the accuracy trade-off. Our experimental results indicate that the estimated TIC values correlate well with the generalization gap under conditions close to the NTK regime.

Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology.

For theoretical assessment, we curate a diverse set of examination questions drawn from widely recognized financial qualification exams, enabling evaluation of LLMs deep understanding and application of financial knowledge. In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline. These results enable a systematic analysis of the capability boundaries of current LLMs in financial applications. We publicly release the benchmark questions and evaluation code to facilitate future research."}

Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations."}

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior."}

Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance. We release VERO to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents."}

To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance."}

This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation."}

Edward Suh"], "title": "SideQuest: Model-Driven KV Cache Management for Long-Horizon Agentic Reasoning", "comment": null, "summary": "Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques."}

However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%."}

However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra."}

However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios."}
