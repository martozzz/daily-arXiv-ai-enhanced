TL;DR: DASH框架通过收敛感知指标和PLR机制，显著提升了组合优化问题的求解效率和性能，同时大幅降低了适应成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM-Driven Heuristic Design（LHD）框架存在两个关键限制：仅基于终点的评估和高适应成本。DASH旨在解决这些问题，提升求解器的效率和性能。

Method: DASH框架通过共同优化求解器搜索机制和运行时调度，并引入PLR机制来高效存档专用求解器，从而支持异构分布下的低成本热启动。

Result: 实验表明，DASH在四个组合优化问题上将运行效率提高了3倍以上，并在不同问题规模下超越了现有基线的求解质量。此外，通过基于配置的热启动，DASH在不同分布下保持了高准确性，同时将LLM适应成本降低了90%以上。

Conclusion: DASH框架通过结合收敛感知指标和Profiled Library Retrieval（PLR）机制，显著提高了组合优化问题的求解效率和性能，同时大幅降低了LLM的适应成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

TL;DR: FIP是一种针对目标模态优化的预训练方法，通过调整掩码难度、损失权重和解码器容量，提升下游任务性能，无需额外数据或计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准预训练策略对所有模态一视同仁，可能导致实际使用模态的表示未优化。FIP旨在针对目标模态优化表示学习。

Method: FIP通过增加目标模态的掩码难度、强化损失权重和提升解码器容量，但不修改共享编码器或需要额外监督。

Result: 在无线信号星座图的掩码建模中，FIP持续提升下游任务性能，无需额外数据或计算。

Conclusion: FIP是一种简单、兼容性强且广泛适用的多模态掩码建模方法，能有效优化目标模态的表示学习。

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and efficient method for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating the discovery of new metal hydrides, with potential for future experimental validation.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

Motivation: 解决现有基于提示的持续学习方法中固定提示分配导致的知识隔离和参数利用不足的问题。

Method: 构建全局提示池并引入任务感知门控路由机制，稀疏激活部分提示以实现动态解耦和协作优化。此外，引入历史感知调制器，利用累积提示激活统计保护常用提示免受过量更新。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于提示共享的持续学习框架通过动态解耦和协作优化任务特定特征表示，显著提高了参数利用效率，并有效减轻了知识遗忘问题。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: A new initialization technique for predictive coding networks reduces training times and improves performance, addressing computational inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The large computational requirements of energy-based learning algorithms like predictive coding hinder their applicability, despite their versatility and mathematical grounding.

Method: A new initialization technique for predictive coding networks that preserves iterative progress from previous training samples.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: The proposed initialization technique for predictive coding networks significantly reduces training times and improves convergence speed and final performance, bridging the gap between predictive coding and backpropagation.

Abstract: Research aimed at scaling up neuroscience inspired learning algorithms for neural networks is accelerating. Recently, a key research area has been the study of energy-based learning algorithms such as predictive coding, due to their versatility and mathematical grounding. However, the applicability of such methods is held back by the large computational requirements caused by their iterative nature. In this work, we address this problem by showing that the choice of initialization of the neurons in a predictive coding network matters significantly and can notably reduce the required training times. Consequently, we propose a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks that aims to preserve the iterative progress made on previous training samples. Our approach suggests a promising path toward reconciling the disparities between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of computational efficiency and final performance. In fact, our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准肿瘤学需要预测临床事件和轨迹，但稀疏、多模态的临床时间序列建模仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: TwinWeaver将多模态临床时间序列数据序列化为文本，利用大型语言模型进行事件预测和风险分层，并构建了Genie Digital Twin (GDT)模型。

Result: GDT显著降低了预测误差（MASE中位数0.87 vs. 0.97），并改善了风险分层（平均C-index 0.703 vs. 0.662），在零样本和微调任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: TwinWeaver框架通过将纵向患者历史序列化为文本，为临床事件预测和风险分层提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了预测精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

### [7] [Noisy but Valid: Robust Statistical Evaluation of LLMs with Imperfect Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20913)
*Chen Feng,Minghe Shen,Ananth Balashankar,Carsten Gerner-Beuerle,Miguel R. D. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 'Noisy but Valid' framework ensures reliable LLM certification despite imperfect judges, using human-labeled calibration to estimate judge behavior, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of reliable certification of LLMs due to imperfections, noise, and bias in 'LLM-as-a-Judge' approaches, which can invalidate statistical guarantees.

Method: Introduces a 'Noisy but Valid' hypothesis testing framework that uses a small human-labeled calibration set to estimate judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), applied to a large judge-labeled dataset with variance-corrected critical thresholds.

Result: The framework guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control despite calibration uncertainty, outperforms direct evaluation under certain conditions, and reveals a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical 'Oracle'.

Conclusion: : The framework provides a theoretical and empirical basis for reliable certification of LLMs, even with imperfect judges, by leveraging a small human-labeled calibration set and a large judge-labeled dataset. It highlights trade-offs among inferential tools and the importance of judge reliability.

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

TL;DR: A machine learning algorithm estimates ICP noninvasively with promising accuracy, though further validation is needed for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) is a critical challenge in care for patients with acute brain injury, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: A machine learning framework integrating system identification and ranking-constrained optimization was developed to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals (ABP, CBv, R-R interval). The framework uses subspace system identification for modeling and convex optimization with ranking constraints for error mapping.

Result: Approximately 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg, and 34.07% had errors between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg, indicating promising accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of a noninvasive ICP estimation approach using a machine learning framework, though further validation and refinement are needed before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

Motivation: 研究在不可知设置下二元分类的最优通用速率，填补了可实现情况理论的空白。

Method: 通过移除分布的可实现性假设，扩展了Bousquet等人的理论，并提出了一个四分类的最优速率理论。

Result: 确定了四种最优速率类型，并发现简单的组合结构可以决定概念类所属的类别。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个完整的理论，用于描述在不可知设置下二元分类的最优通用速率，扩展了Bousquet等人的可实现情况理论。研究发现，最优速率可以分为四种类型：$e^{-n}$、$e^{-o(n)}$、$o(n^{-1/2})$或任意慢速，并通过简单的组合结构确定了每种概念类所属的类别。

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

### [10] [Monotone Optimisation with Learned Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20983)
*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned HM-RI networks enhance POA by predicting projections via radial inverse, improving speed and accuracy in monotone optimisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of applying POA in scenarios where objective and constraint functions are only available through data, requiring explicit function forms.

Method: Introduces Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, which predict projection primitives via radial inverse, avoiding costly bisection in POA. The method includes theoretical characterization and relaxed monotonicity conditions.

Result: HM-RI networks achieve substantial speed-ups in monotone optimisation benchmarks (e.g., indefinite quadratic programming) while maintaining strong solution quality.

Conclusion: The proposed HM-RI networks integrate learned models into the POA algorithm, providing significant speed-ups while maintaining solution quality, outperforming baselines that ignore monotonic structure.

Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.

*Abdullah Akgül,Gulcin Baykal,Manuel Haußmann,Mustafa Mert Çelikok,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates active inference into distributional reinforcement learning, providing a sample-efficient solution for complex robotic control without transition dynamics modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency of reinforcement learning in handling both sensory state organization and far-sighted planning, and the limited application of active inference in artificial intelligence.

Method: The authors present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches, seamlessly integrating active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework.

Result: The result is a novel framework that combines active inference with distributional reinforcement learning, offering performance advantages without the need for transition dynamics modeling.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework provides a sample-efficient solution without requiring transition dynamics modeling, addressing both sensory state organization and far-sighted planning challenges.

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A pre-trained encoder for child development monitoring outperforms traditional methods with minimal data, enabling effective ML deployment in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data bottleneck in deploying machine learning models for child development monitoring in new countries, where reliable models typically require large datasets but programs often start with very few samples.

Method: The study introduces a pre-trained encoder trained on data from 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. Transfer learning techniques are applied to explain the model's few-shot generalization capabilities.

Result: The pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 with only 50 training samples, outperforming cold-start gradient boosting by 8-12%. With 500 samples, the AUC improves to 0.73, and zero-shot deployment achieves AUCs up to 0.84 in unseen countries.

Conclusion: The pre-trained encoder significantly improves the feasibility of machine learning for monitoring child development in resource-constrained settings, achieving better performance with fewer samples compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

### [13] [Top-k on a Budget: Adaptive Ranking with Weak and Strong Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20989)
*Lutz Oettershagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ACE and ACE-W algorithms to efficiently identify top-k items using a combination of noisy weak and scarce strong oracles, reducing expensive strong calls while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of identifying top-k items when exact valuations are expensive, by leveraging a combination of noisy weak oracles and scarce high-fidelity strong oracles.

Method: The paper introduces two algorithms: ACE, which adaptively focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, and ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that further optimizes weak budget allocation before running ACE.

Result: The results show that ACE achieves the same theoretical bound as STC but with fewer strong calls in practice, while ACE-W further reduces strong costs by adaptively allocating weak budget.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that ACE and ACE-W algorithms significantly reduce the number of expensive strong oracle calls while maintaining accuracy, outperforming the baseline STC method.

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

TL;DR: 论文提出两个新基准测试，评估模型的迭代自我修正能力和行为理性，结果显示领域特定的训练使小型模型在多个指标上优于大型API模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）基准测试忽略了运筹学（OR）实践中的诊断循环，无法有效评估模型在实际应用中的迭代自我修正能力和行为理性。

Method: 引入了两个新的基准测试ORDebug和ORBias，分别评估模型的自我修正能力和行为理性。ORDebug包含5,000多个问题，涵盖9种错误类型；ORBias包含2,000个报童问题实例（1,000个样本内和1,000个样本外）。

Result: 在26个模型和12,000多个样本中，8B规模的模型通过领域特定的RLVR训练，在修复率（95.3% vs 86.2%）、诊断准确性（62.4% vs 47.8%）和修复速度（2.25 vs 3.78步）上显著优于前沿API模型。ORBias测试中，课程训练实现了唯一的负偏差漂移（-9.6%），并将系统偏差降低了48%（从20.0%降至10.4%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过过程级评估和可验证的反馈，领域特定的RLVR训练能够使小型模型在修复率和诊断准确性方面超越大型前沿API模型，同时显著减少系统偏差。

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZonghengGuo/SigmaPPG.

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a class of generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportionally to their a priori unknown value, their reward. We focus on the case where the reward has a specified, actionable structure, namely that it is submodular. We show submodularity can be harnessed to retrieve upper bounds on the reward of compositional objects that have not yet been observed. We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound. Following the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle, we then introduce SUBo-GFN, which uses the submodular upper bounds to train a GFN. We show that SUBo-GFN generates orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same number of queries to the reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SUBo-GFN in terms of distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real-world submodular tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as part of compound AI systems that coordinate multiple modules (e.g., retrievers, tools, verifiers) over long-horizon workflows. Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

Abstract: The rapidly growing ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it increasingly challenging to manage and utilize the vast and dynamic pool of models effectively. We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models.

Abstract: Planning effective interventions in biological systems requires treatment-effect models that adapt to unseen biological contexts by identifying their specific underlying mechanisms. Yet single-cell perturbation datasets span only a handful of biological contexts, and existing methods cannot leverage new interventional evidence at inference time to adapt beyond their training data. To meta-learn a perturbation effect estimator, we present MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) pretrained on synthetic data generated from a prior over causal perturbations. Given a set of experiments, MapPFN uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions, without gradient-based optimization. Despite being pretrained on in silico gene knockouts alone, MapPFN identifies differentially expressed genes, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/marvinsxtr/MapPFN.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

Abstract: While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects.

Abstract: Recent machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting often employ a monolithic architecture, where distinct physical mechanisms (advection, transport), diffusion-like mixing, thermodynamic processes, and forcing are represented implicitly within a single large network. This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

Abstract: The scalability of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for unbiased Boltzmann sampling remains limited in high-dimensional systems due to the cost of Jacobian-determinant evaluation, which requires $D$ backpropagation passes through the flow layers. Existing stochastic Jacobian estimators such as the Hutchinson trace estimator reduce computation but introduce bias, while the recently proposed Flow Perturbation method is unbiased yet suffers from high variance. We present \textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines.

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

Abstract: We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding. Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

Abstract: Motivated by challenges in conditional generative modeling, where the target conditional density takes the form of a ratio f1 over f2, this paper develops a theoretical framework for approximating such ratio-type functionals. Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\times$ speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.

Abstract: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used analytical method for chemical substance detection, but measurement reliability tends to deteriorate in the presence of interfering substances. In particular, interfering substances cause nonspecific peaks, residence time shifts, and increased background noise, resulting in reduced sensitivity and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework. Representatively, the proposed method is shown to consistently achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient values above 0.9 while preserving peak number diversity and reducing false alarms in the discrimination model.

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) solvers, implemented with graph neural networks (GNNs), have introduced new approaches for solving routing problems. Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.

Abstract: LLM unlearning is a technique to remove the impacts of undesirable knowledge from the model without retraining from scratch, which is indispensable towards trustworthy AI. Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, in-contextualized unlearning is lightweight for precise unlearning but vulnerable to prompt removal or reverse engineering attacks. In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools for modeling complex data distributions, yet their purely data-driven nature limits applicability in practical engineering and scientific problems where physical laws need to be followed. This paper proposes Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD), a framework that unifies diffusion modeling and first-principles physical constraints by introducing a virtual residual observation sampled from a Laplace distribution to supervise generation during training. To further integrate physical laws, a conditional embedding module is incorporated to inject physical information into the denoising network at multiple layers, ensuring consistent guidance throughout the diffusion process. The proposed PILD framework is concise, modular, and broadly applicable to problems governed by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, as well as algebraic equations or inequality constraints. Extensive experiments across engineering and scientific tasks including estimating vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow and plasma dynamics, demonstrate that our PILD substantially improves accuracy, stability, and generalization over existing physics-informed and diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.

Abstract: Identifying the extent to which every temporal segment influences a model's predictions is essential for explaining model decisions and increasing transparency. While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification.

Abstract: Reliability-centered prognostics for rotating machinery requires early warning signals that remain accurate under nonstationary operating conditions, domain shifts across speed/load/sensors, and severe class imbalance, while keeping the false-alarm rate small and predictable. We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset. While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

Abstract: This paper investigates search in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). Conventional wisdom holds that long-term predictions and compounding errors are the primary obstacles for model-based RL. We challenge this view, showing that search is not a plug-and-play replacement for a learned policy. Surprisingly, we find that search can harm performance even when the model is highly accurate. Instead, we show that mitigating distribution shift matters more than improving model or value function accuracy. Building on this insight, we identify key techniques for enabling effective search, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple popular benchmark domains.

Abstract: The increasing scale of graph datasets has significantly improved the performance of graph representation learning methods, but it has also introduced substantial training challenges. Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, the effective management of Autonomous Electric Taxi (AET) fleets faces a critical challenge in environments with dynamic and uncertain charging availability. While most existing research assumes a static charging network, this simplification creates a significant gap between theoretical models and real-world operations. To bridge this gap, we propose GAT-PEARL, a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework that learns an adaptive operational policy. Our approach integrates a graph attention network (GAT) to effectively extract robust spatial representations under infrastructure layouts and model the complex spatiotemporal relationships of the urban environment, and employs probabilistic embeddings for actor-critic reinforcement learning (PEARL) to enable rapid, inference-based adaptation to changes in charging network layouts without retraining. Through extensive simulations on real-world data in Chengdu, China, we demonstrate that GAT-PEARL significantly outperforms conventional reinforcement learning baselines, showing superior generalization to unseen infrastructure layouts and achieving higher overall operational efficiency in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a statistical learning problem when the distribution of training (source) data is different from that of test (target) data. In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments under various distribution shift scenarios show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, especially when target data are extremely scarce.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a transformative solution to alleviate urban congestion by utilizing low-altitude airspace, thereby reducing pressure on ground transportation networks. To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems. This work lays a solid foundation for advancing intelligent urban mobility solutions through the coordination of air and ground transportation modes.

Abstract: We propose a new convex loss for SVMs, both for the binary classification and for the regression models. Therefore, we show the mathematical derivation of the dual problems and we experiment them with several small data-sets. The minimal dimension of those data-sets is due to the difficult scalability of the SVM method to bigger instances. This preliminary study should prove that using pattern correlations inside the loss function could enhance the generalisation performances. Coherently, results show that generalisation measures are never worse than the standard losses and several times they are better. In our opinion, it should be considered a careful study of this loss, coupled with shallow and deep neural networks. In fact, we present some novel results obtained with those architectures.

Abstract: Controlling memorization in diffusion models is critical for applications that require generated data to closely match the training distribution. Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale neural networks by conditionally activating a small subset of experts, where the router plays a central role in determining expert specialization and overall model performance. However, many modern MoE systems still adopt linear routers in raw high-dimensional representation spaces, where representation mismatch, angular concentration, and scale-sensitive scoring can jointly undermine routing discriminability and stable expert specialization. In this work, we propose Low-rank \& Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R), a unified routing framework that reshapes both the routing space and scoring geometry. L2R performs expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space and introduces Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to explicitly control the Lipschitz behavior of routing functions, yielding smoother and more stable routing geometry. In addition, L2R incorporates a parameter-efficient multi-anchor routing mechanism to enhance expert expressiveness. Extensive experiments on a large-scale language MoE model and a vision MoE setting on ImageNet demonstrate that L2R consistently improves routing stability, expert specialization, and overall model performance.

Abstract: A reliable reward model is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses on length and sycophantic bias further validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating reward hacking behaviors.

Abstract: Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) is an emerging architecture for LLM decoding that separates state-heavy, KV-cache-dominated Attention computation from stateless, compute-intensive FFN computation, connected by per-step communication. While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a principled approach for optimizing expensive black-box functions, with Expected Improvement (EI) being one of the most widely used acquisition functions. Despite its empirical success, EI is known to be overly exploitative and can converge to suboptimal stationary points. We propose Expected Improvement via Gradient Norms (EI-GN), a novel acquisition function that applies the improvement principle to a gradient-aware auxiliary objective, thereby promoting sampling in regions that are both high-performing and approaching first-order stationarity. EI-GN relies on gradient observations used to learn gradient-enhanced surrogate models that enable principled gradient inference from function evaluations. We derive a tractable closed-form expression for EI-GN that allows efficient optimization and show that the proposed acquisition is consistent with the improvement-based acquisition framework. Empirical evaluations on standard BO benchmarks demonstrate that EI-GN yields consistent improvements against standard baselines. We further demonstrate applicability of EI-GN to control policy learning problems.

Abstract: The forward pass of a Transformer can be seen as an interacting particle system on the unit sphere: time plays the role of layers, particles that of token embeddings, and the unit sphere idealizes layer normalization. In some weight settings the system can even be seen as a gradient flow for an explicit energy, and one can make sense of the infinite context length (mean-field) limit thanks to Wasserstein gradient flows. In this paper we study the effect of the perceptron block in this setting, and show that critical points are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.

Abstract: Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.
  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series forecasting, as a typical problem in the field of time series prediction, has a wide range of applications in weather forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and other scenarios. However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.

Abstract: Network traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in intelligent network operations, but existing techniques often perform poorly when faced with limited data. Additionally, multi-task learning methods struggle with task imbalance and negative transfer, especially when modeling various service types. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sim-MSTNet, a multi-task spatiotemporal network traffic forecasting model based on the sim2real approach. Our method leverages a simulator to generate synthetic data, effectively addressing the issue of poor generalization caused by data scarcity. By employing a domain randomization technique, we reduce the distributional gap between synthetic and real data through bi-level optimization of both sample weighting and model training. Moreover, Sim-MSTNet incorporates attention-based mechanisms to selectively share knowledge between tasks and applies dynamic loss weighting to balance task objectives. Extensive experiments on two open-source datasets show that Sim-MSTNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving enhanced accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Exploration is essential in reinforcement learning as an agent relies on trial and error to learn an optimal policy. However, when rewards are sparse, naive exploration strategies, like noise injection, are often insufficient. Intrinsic rewards can also provide principled guidance for exploration by, for example, combining them with extrinsic rewards to optimize a policy or using them to train subpolicies for hierarchical learning. However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments. We demonstrate that IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in discrete and continuous environments, and formally analyze the optimization problem solved by IRPO. Our code is available at https://github.com/Mgineer117/IRPO.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve explicit chain-of-thought expansion by imitating deep thinking behaviors of humans, demonstrating excellent performance in complex task scenarios. However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format. Experimental results indicate that DiPO enables the model to spontaneously adjust inference overhead, significantly reducing redundant tokens without losing performance due to thought compression.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise ($\varepsilon$) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.

Abstract: Large language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\times$ and KV cache by $R\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\% and decoding speedups up to 117\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models.

Abstract: Many computer vision tasks share substantial overlapping information, yet conventional codecs tend to ignore this, leading to redundant and inefficient representations. The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding. These results highlight the practical value of revisiting Gray-Wyner theory in modern machine learning contexts, bridging classic information theory with task-driven representation learning.

Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

Abstract: Driven by the evolution toward 6G and AI-native edge intelligence, network operations increasingly require predictive and risk-aware adaptation under stringent computation and latency constraints. Network Traffic Matrix (TM), which characterizes flow volumes between nodes, is a fundamental signal for proactive traffic engineering. However, accurate TM forecasting remains challenging due to the stochastic, non-linear, and bursty nature of network dynamics. Existing discriminative models often suffer from over-smoothing and provide limited uncertainty awareness, leading to poor fidelity under extreme bursts. To address these limitations, we propose LEAD, a Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Adapter-based conditional Diffusion model. First, LEAD adopts a "Traffic-to-Image" paradigm to transform traffic matrices into RGB images, enabling global dependency modeling via vision backbones. Then, we design a "Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter" model, which efficiently captures temporal semantics with limited computational cost. Moreover, we propose a Dual-Conditioning Strategy to precisely guide a diffusion model to generate complex, dynamic network traffic matrices. Experiments on the Abilene and GEANT datasets demonstrate that LEAD outperforms all baselines. On the Abilene dataset, LEAD attains a remarkable 45.2% reduction in RMSE against the best baseline, with the error margin rising only marginally from 0.1098 at one-step to 0.1134 at 20-step predictions. Meanwhile, on the GEANT dataset, LEAD achieves a 0.0258 RMSE at 20-step prediction horizon which is 27.3% lower than the best baseline.

Abstract: Illicit financial activities such as money laundering often manifest through recurrent topological patterns in transaction networks. Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns. These findings suggest that graph-based representation learning on synthetic data provides a viable path toward developing AI-driven tools for detecting illicit behaviors, overcoming the limitations of financial datasets.

Abstract: While works such as OneRec have validated the scaling laws of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, they rely on a cumbersome separate vocabulary. This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a "Symmetric Conservatism" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the "Reward Collapse" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a "Boost Factor" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an "Entropy Aware Penalty" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.

Abstract: LLM role-playing, i.e., using LLMs to simulate specific personas, has emerged as a key capability in various applications, such as companionship, content creation, and digital games. While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

Abstract: Block-coordinate descent (BCD) is the method of choice to solve numerous large scale optimization problems, however their theoretical study for non-convex optimization, has received less attention. In this paper, we present a new block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework to tackle non-convex composite optimization problems, ensuring decrease of the objective function and convergence to a solution. This framework is general enough to include variable metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternated minimization updates. This generality allows to encompass three versions of the most used solvers in the sparse precision matrix estimation problem, deemed Graphical Lasso: graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC. We demonstrate the value of this new framework on non-convex sparse precision matrix estimation problems, providing convergence guarantees and up to a $100$-fold reduction in the number of iterations required to reach state-of-the-art estimation quality.

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training alignment for language models is effective, but also costly and unstable in practice, owing to its complicated training process. To address this, we propose a training-free inference method to sample directly from the optimal RL policy. The transition probability applied to Masked Language Modeling (MLM) consists of a reference policy model and an energy term. Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate. Moreover, to ensure practical efficiency, ETS leverages modern acceleration frameworks alongside tailored importance sampling estimators, substantially reducing inference latency while provably preserving sampling quality. Experiments on MLM (including autoregressive models and diffusion language models) across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show that our ETS consistently improves generation quality, validating its effectiveness and design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In many applications of LLMs, natural language responses often have an underlying structure such as representing discrete labels, numerical values, or graphs. Yet, existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods operate only in language space and largely disregard structural information. We address this by modeling LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure. By equipping this structure with a dissimilarity measure, we can compute Bayes-optimal responses. These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness. Our decision-theoretic framework is applicable to any problem that admits a latent response structure and enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions.

Abstract: Many-Task Learning refers to the setting where a large number of related tasks need to be learned, the exact relationships between tasks are not known. We introduce the Cascaded Transfer Learning, a novel many-task transfer learning paradigm where information (e.g. model parameters) cascades hierarchically through tasks that are learned by individual models of the same class, while respecting given budget constraints. The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches.

Abstract: Spatial covariance matrices of EEG signals are Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) and lie on a Riemannian manifold, yet the theoretical connection between embedding geometry and optimization dynamics remains unexplored. We provide a formal analysis linking embedding choice to gradient conditioning and numerical stability for SPD manifolds, establishing three theoretical results: (1) BWSPD's $\sqrtκ$ gradient conditioning (vs $κ$ for Log-Euclidean) via Daleckii-Kreĭn matrices provides better gradient conditioning on high-dimensional inputs ($d \geq 22$), with this advantage reducing on low-dimensional inputs ($d \leq 8$) where eigendecomposition overhead dominates; (2) Embedding-Space Batch Normalization (BN-Embed) approximates Riemannian normalization up to $O(\varepsilon^2)$ error, yielding $+26\%$ accuracy on 56-channel ERP data but negligible effect on 8-channel SSVEP data, matching the channel-count-dependent prediction; (3) bi-Lipschitz bounds prove BWSPD tokens preserve manifold distances with distortion governed solely by the condition ratio $κ$. We validate these predictions via a unified Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within identical architecture across 1,500+ runs on three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP; 36 subjects). Our Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, substantially outperforming classical Riemannian classifiers and recent SPD baselines, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with similar training time.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

Abstract: To promote cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, the reward signals of all agents can be aggregated together, forming global rewards that are commonly known as the fully cooperative setting. However, global rewards are usually noisy because they contain the contributions of all agents, which have to be resolved in the credit assignment process. On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches. By using a graph of interaction between agents, our method discerns the individual agent contribution in a more fine-grained manner than a global reward, while alleviating the cooperation problem with agents' local reward. We also introduce a practical approach for approximating such a graph. Our experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, enabling improvements over the traditional local and global reward settings.

Abstract: Hyperbolic space is quickly gaining traction as a promising geometry for hierarchical and robust representation learning. A core open challenge is the development of a mathematical formulation of hyperbolic neural networks that is both efficient and captures the key properties of hyperbolic space. The Lorentz model of hyperbolic space has been shown to enable both fast forward and backward propagation. However, we prove that, with the current formulation of Lorentz linear layers, the hyperbolic norms of the outputs scale logarithmically with the number of gradient descent steps, nullifying the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry. We propose a new Lorentz linear layer grounded in the well-known ``distance-to-hyperplane" formulation. We prove that our formulation results in the usual linear scaling of output hyperbolic norms with respect to the number of gradient descent steps. Our new formulation, together with further algorithmic efficiencies through Lorentzian activation functions and a new caching strategy results in neural networks fully abiding by hyperbolic geometry while simultaneously bridging the computation gap to Euclidean neural networks.

Abstract: Real-world time series exhibit complex and evolving dynamics, making accurate forecasting extremely challenging. Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

Abstract: Predicting spatial gene expression from H&E histology offers a scalable and clinically accessible alternative to sequencing, but realizing clinical impact requires models that generalize across cancer types and capture biologically coherent signals. Prior work is often limited to per-cancer settings and variance-based evaluation, leaving functional relevance underexplored. We introduce HistoPrism, an efficient transformer-based architecture for pan-cancer prediction of gene expression from histology. To evaluate biological meaning, we introduce a pathway-level benchmark, shifting assessment from isolated gene-level variance to coherent functional pathways. HistoPrism not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art models on highly variable genes , but also more importantly, achieves substantial gains on pathway-level prediction, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically coherent transcriptomic patterns. With strong pan-cancer generalization and improved efficiency, HistoPrism establishes a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from routinely available histology.

Abstract: Standard deep learning relies on Backpropagation (BP), which is constrained by biologically implausible weight symmetry and suffers from significant gradient interference within dense representations. To mitigate these bottlenecks, we propose Selective Adaptive Learning (SAL), a training method that combines selective parameter activation with adaptive area partitioning. Specifically, SAL decomposes the parameter space into mutually exclusive, sample-dependent regions. This decoupling mitigates gradient interference across divergent semantic patterns and addresses explicit weight symmetry requirements through our refined feedback alignment. Empirically, SAL demonstrates competitive convergence rates, leading to improved classification performance across 10 standard benchmarks. Additionally, SAL achieves numerical consistency and competitive accuracy even in deep regimes (up to 128 layers) and large-scale models (up to 1B parameters). Our approach is loosely inspired by biological learning mechanisms, offering a plausible alternative that contributes to the study of scalable neural network training.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of specific training data from a model, a need driven by privacy regulations and robustness concerns. Existing approaches typically modify model parameters, but such updates can be unstable, computationally costly, and limited by local approximations. We introduce Representation Unlearning, a framework that performs unlearning directly in the model's representation space. Instead of modifying model parameters, we learn a transformation over representations that imposes an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. We derive variational surrogates that make this objective tractable and show how they can be instantiated in two practical regimes: when both retain and forget data are available, and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that Representation Unlearning achieves more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and greater computational efficiency than parameter-centric baselines.

Abstract: Causal Disentangled Representation Learning(CDRL) aims to learn and disentangle low dimensional representations and their underlying causal structure from observations. However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms other methods.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for quantifying the similarity between representations through the lens of \textit{usable information}, offering a rigorous theoretical and empirical synthesis across three key dimensions. First, addressing functional similarity, we establish a formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information. We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one. Third, we demonstrate that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity. We unify these concepts through a task-granularity hierarchy: similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on any coarser derivative, establishing representational similarity as the limit of maximum granularity: input reconstruction.

Abstract: Current approaches to reducing undesired capabilities in language models are largely post hoc, and can thus be easily bypassed by adversaries. A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute.

Abstract: Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) are a promising substrate for energy-efficient control policies, but training them for high-dimensional, long-horizon reinforcement learning remains challenging. Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM. In addition, to make SATR practical at scale, we introduce a bitset implementation for binary spiking and binary weights, substantially reducing wall-clock training time and enabling fast RSNN policy search.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting during knowledge injection severely undermines the continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.

Abstract: Deep learning models struggle with uncertainty estimation. Many approaches are either computationally infeasible or underestimate uncertainty. We investigate \textit{BatchEnsemble} as a general and scalable method for uncertainty estimation across both tabular and time series tasks. To extend BatchEnsemble to sequential modeling, we introduce GRUBE, a novel BatchEnsemble GRU cell. We compare the BatchEnsemble to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensemble models. Our results show that BatchEnsemble matches the uncertainty estimation performance of deep ensembles, and clearly outperforms Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE achieves similar or better performance in both prediction and uncertainty estimation. These findings show that BatchEnsemble and GRUBE achieve similar performance with fewer parameters and reduced training and inference time compared to traditional ensembles.

Abstract: Many learning problems require predicting sets of objects when the number of objects is not known beforehand. Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Graph Federated Learning (GFL) enables distributed graph representation learning while protecting the privacy of graph data. However, GFL suffers from heterogeneity arising from diverse node features and structural topologies across multiple clients. To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neural networks adapt through first-order parameter updates, yet it remains unclear whether such updates preserve logical coherence. We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse. These results suggest that failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning may stem from common structural limitations inherent to the LPA.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks frequently exhibit significant performance degradation in the out-of-distribution test scenario. While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Parallel thinking enhances LLM reasoning by multi-path sampling and aggregation. In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding. Experiments show that T2 significantly reduces cost while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more efficient parallel thinking.

Abstract: Mixed-precision computations are a hallmark of the current stage of AI, driving the progress in large language models towards efficient, locally deployable solutions. This article addresses the floating-point computation of compositionally-rich functions, concentrating on transformer inference. Based on the rounding error analysis of a composition $f(g(\mathrm{x}))$, we provide an adaptive strategy that selects a small subset of components of $g(\mathrm{x})$ to be computed more accurately while all other computations can be carried out with lower accuracy. We then explain how this strategy can be applied to different compositions within a transformer and illustrate its overall effect on transformer inference. We study the effectiveness of this algorithm numerically on GPT-2 models and demonstrate that already very low recomputation rates allow for improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy.

Abstract: Modern deep-learning training is not memoryless. Updates depend on optimizer moments and averaging, data-order policies (random reshuffling vs with-replacement, staged augmentations and replay), the nonconvex path, and auxiliary state (teacher EMA/SWA, contrastive queues, BatchNorm statistics). This survey organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility. It introduces seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and a reporting checklist with audit artifacts (order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, RNG contracts). The conclusion is a protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement that attributes how much training history matters across models, data, and regimes.

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for ship propeller design. While traditional forward machine learning models predict the performance of mechanical components based on given design parameters, GenAI models aim to generate designs that achieve specified performance targets. In particular, we employ conditional flow matching to establish a bidirectional mapping between design parameters and simulated noise that is conditioned on performance labels. This approach enables the generation of multiple valid designs corresponding to the same performance targets by sampling over the noise vector.
  To support model training, we generate data using a vortex lattice method for numerical simulation and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and the amount of available data. We further propose data augmentation using pseudo-labels derived from less data-intensive forward surrogate models, which can often improve overall model performance. Finally, we present examples of distinct propeller geometries that exhibit nearly identical performance characteristics, illustrating the versatility and potential of GenAI in engineering design.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently made significant advances in accurate time-series forecasting, but even these architectures struggle to scale efficiently while capturing long-term temporal dynamics. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.

Abstract: We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic. Overall, our results provide a mathematical explanation for the emergence of equivariant structures in the weights of neural networks during training -- a phenomenon that is consistently observed in practice.

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

Abstract: Deep networks learn internal representations whose geometry--how features bend, rotate, and evolve--affects both generalization and robustness. Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the "twist" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity.

Abstract: Clustering tabular data is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to heterogeneous feature types, diverse data-generating mechanisms, and the absence of transferable inductive biases across datasets. Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization in supervised tabular learning by amortizing Bayesian inference under a broad synthetic prior. Extending this paradigm to clustering is nontrivial: clustering is unsupervised, admits a combinatorial and permutation-invariant output space, and requires inferring the number of clusters. We introduce TabClustPFN, a prior-fitted network for tabular data clustering that performs amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. Pretrained on synthetic datasets drawn from a flexible clustering prior, TabClustPFN clusters unseen datasets in a single forward pass, without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning. The model naturally handles heterogeneous numerical and categorical features and adapts to a wide range of clustering structures. Experiments on synthetic data and curated real-world tabular benchmarks show that TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings. Code is available at https://github.com/Tianqi-Zhao/TabClustPFN.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are typically deterministic in nature and lack intrinsic mechanisms to quantify epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the model's lack of knowledge or ignorance of its own representations. We theoretically motivate negative log-density of an embedding as a proxy for the epistemic uncertainty, where low-density regions signify model ignorance. The proposed method REPVLM computes the probability density on the hyperspherical manifold of the VLM embeddings using Riemannian Flow Matching. We empirically demonstrate that REPVLM achieves near-perfect correlation between uncertainty and prediction error, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Beyond classification, we also demonstrate that the model also provides a scalable metric for out-of-distribution detection and automated data curation.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems admit multiple terminal solutions of comparable quality, where the goal is not to identify a single optimum but to represent a diverse set of high-quality outcomes. Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: While end-to-end self-supervised learning with backpropagation (global BP-SSL) has become central for training modern AI systems, theories of local self-supervised learning (local-SSL) have struggled to build functional representations in deep neural networks. To establish a link between global and local rules, we first develop a theory for deep linear networks: we identify conditions for local-SSL algorithms (like Forward-forward or CLAPP) to implement exactly the same weight update as a global BP-SSL. Starting from the theoretical insights, we then develop novel variants of local-SSL algorithms to approximate global BP-SSL in deep non-linear convolutional neural networks. Variants that improve the similarity between gradient updates of local-SSL with those of global BP-SSL also show better performance on image datasets (CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet). The best local-SSL rule with the CLAPP loss function matches the performance of a comparable global BP-SSL with InfoNCE or CPC-like loss functions, and improves upon state-of-the-art for local SSL on these benchmarks.

Abstract: Key--value (KV) caching enables fast autoregressive decoding but at long contexts becomes a dominant bottleneck in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) capacity and bandwidth. A common mitigation is to compress cached keys and values by projecting per-head matrixes to a lower rank, storing only the projections in the HBM. However, existing post-training approaches typically fit these projections using SVD-style proxy objectives, which may poorly reflect end-to-end reconstruction after softmax, value mixing, and subsequent decoder-layer transformations.
  For these reasons, we introduce StiefAttention, a post-training KV-cache compression method that learns \emph{orthonormal} projection bases by directly minimizing \emph{decoder-layer output reconstruction error}. StiefAttention additionally precomputes, for each layer, an error-rank profile over candidate ranks, enabling flexible layer-wise rank allocation under a user-specified error budget. Noteworthy, on Llama3-8B under the same conditions, StiefAttention outperforms EigenAttention by $11.9$ points on C4 perplexity and $5.4\%$ on 0-shot MMLU accuracy at iso-compression, yielding lower relative error and higher cosine similarity with respect to the original decoder-layer outputs.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to map independent factors of variation to independent representation components. On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.
  We introduce \textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\mathcal{T}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.
  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/ICML26-anon/XFactors}{github.com/ICML26-anon/XFactors}.

Abstract: Model merging efficiently aggregates capabilities from multiple fine-tuned models into a single one, operating purely in parameter space without original data or expensive re-computation. Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline. Extensive experiments on the ResNet/Vit family across 20/8 visual classification tasks, involving thousands of finetuning models, robustly confirm the impact of different hyperparameters on the generalization of $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$ predicted by our theoretical results.

Abstract: Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.

Abstract: We consider representation misdirection (RM), a class of LLM unlearning methods that achieves forgetting by manipulating the forget-representations, that is, latent representations of forget samples. Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors.

Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.

Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a practical offline imitation learning method, but it often fails when expert demonstrations are limited. Recent works have introduced a class of architectures named predictive inverse dynamics models (PIDM) that combine a future state predictor with an inverse dynamics model (IDM). While PIDM often outperforms BC, the reasons behind its benefits remain unclear. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation: PIDM introduces a bias-variance tradeoff. While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\% more samples than PIDM.

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

Abstract: Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) enable efficient amortized inference but lack transparent access to their learned priors and kernels. This opacity hinders their use in downstream tasks, such as surrogate-based optimization, that require explicit covariance models. We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines.

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %.

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

Abstract: Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.

Abstract: Knapsack and Top-k operators are useful for selecting discrete subsets of variables. However, their integration into neural networks is challenging as they are piecewise constant, yielding gradients that are zero almost everywhere. In this paper, we propose a unified framework casting these operators as dynamic programs, and derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing the underlying recursions. On the algorithmic side, we develop efficient parallel algorithms supporting both deterministic and stochastic forward passes, and vector-Jacobian products for the backward pass. On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections. Finally, on the experimental side, we demonstrate our framework on a decision-focused learning benchmark, a constrained dynamic assortment RL problem, and an extension of discrete VAEs.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of encrypted network traffic, effective traffic classification has become essential for network security and quality of service management. Current machine learning and deep learning approaches for traffic classification face three critical challenges: computational inefficiency of Transformer architectures, inadequate traffic representations with loss of crucial byte-level features while retaining detrimental biases, and poor handling of long-tail distributions in real-world data. We propose NetMamba+, a framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) an efficient architecture considering Mamba and Flash Attention mechanisms, (2) a multimodal traffic representation scheme that preserves essential traffic information while eliminating biases, and (3) a label distribution-aware fine-tuning strategy. Evaluation experiments on massive datasets encompassing four main classification tasks showcase NetMamba+'s superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.44\% in F1 score. Moreover, NetMamba+ demonstrates excellent efficiency, achieving 1.7x higher inference throughput than the best baseline while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba+ exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. Additionally, we implement an online traffic classification system that demonstrates robust real-world performance with a throughput of 261.87 Mb/s. As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

Abstract: Machine learning models are widely regarded as a way forward to tackle multi-query challenges that arise once expensive black-box simulations such as computational fluid dynamics are investigated. However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable method to approximate the kernel of the Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA). For this, we use a surrogate deep neural network (DNN) that learns a compact feature representation whose inner product replicates the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This avoids the need to compute large Jacobians. Training relies solely on efficient Jacobian-vector products, allowing to compute predictive uncertainty on large-scale pre-trained DNNs. Experimental results show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations. Notwithstanding, biasing the learned kernel significantly enhances out-of-distribution detection. This remarks the benefits of the proposed method for finding better kernels than the NTK in the context of LLA to compute prediction uncertainty given a pre-trained DNN.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to leverage experience across a distribution of tasks on which the agent can train at will, enabling faster learning of optimal policies on new test tasks. Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

Abstract: Foundation models, despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, remain vulnerable to spurious correlations and 'Clever Hans' strategies. Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning integrates predictive modeling and combinatorial optimization by training models to directly improve decision quality rather than prediction accuracy alone. Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.

Abstract: Global air quality forecasting grapples with extreme spatial heterogeneity and the poor generalization of existing transductive models to unseen regions. To tackle this, we propose OmniAir, a semantic topology learning framework tailored for global station-level prediction. By encoding invariant physical environmental attributes into generalizable station identities and dynamically constructing adaptive sparse topologies, our approach effectively captures long-range non-Euclidean correlations and physical diffusion patterns across unevenly distributed global networks. We further curate WorldAir, a massive dataset covering over 7,800 stations worldwide. Extensive experiments show that OmniAir achieves state-of-the-art performance against 18 baselines, maintaining high efficiency and scalability with speeds nearly 10 times faster than existing models, while effectively bridging the monitoring gap in data-sparse regions.

Abstract: Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

Abstract: We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.
  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.
  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) identifies which training examples most influenced a model's prediction. The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \emph{(ii)} forming the $D \times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality. LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA practical at frontier scale.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous data into unified patient representations to support clinical outcome prediction. However, real-world medical datasets commonly contain systematic biases from multiple sources, which poses significant challenges for medical multimodal representation learning. Existing approaches typically focus on effective multimodal fusion, neglecting inherent biased features that affect the generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework that identifies and handles the biases through structural causal analysis introduced by latent confounders. Our method employs a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream neural networks to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, utilizing generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization for effective decorrelation. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning methods. Comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to "induce interpretability". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\ell_1, \ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

Abstract: Medical multimodal learning faces significant challenges with missing modalities prevalent in clinical practice. Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Data-based optimization (DBO) offers a promising approach for efficiently optimizing shape for better aerodynamic performance by leveraging a pretrained surrogate model for offline evaluations during iterations. However, DBO heavily relies on the quality of the training database. Samples outside the training distribution encountered during optimization can lead to significant prediction errors, potentially misleading the optimization process. Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance. Results demonstrate that UA-DBO consistently reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves superior performance gains compared to original DBO. Moreover, compared to multipoint optimization based on full computational simulations, UA-DBO offers comparable optimization effectiveness while significantly accelerating optimization speed.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning is often \emph{nonstationary}: rewards and dynamics drift, accelerate, oscillate, and trigger abrupt switches in the optimal action. Existing theory often represents nonstationarity with coarse-scale models that measure \emph{how much} the environment changes, not \emph{how} it changes locally -- even though acceleration and near-ties drive tracking error and policy chattering. We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length--curvature--kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness. We prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions that certify local stability away from switch regimes. Building on these results, we introduce \textit{Homotopy-Tracking RL (HT-RL)} and \textit{HT-MCTS}, lightweight wrappers that estimate replay-based proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity online and adapt learning or planning intensity accordingly. Experiments show improved tracking and dynamic regret over matched static baselines, with the largest gains in oscillatory and switch-prone regimes.

Abstract: Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

Abstract: Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG) focuses on mitigating both domain and label shifts, both of which fundamentally shape the model's decision boundaries, particularly under heterogeneous long-tailed distributions across domains. Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL.

Abstract: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is often measured at the performance or last-layer representation level, overlooking the underlying mechanisms. We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning.

Abstract: The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.

Abstract: Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

Abstract: Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.

Abstract: We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.

Abstract: Quantifying degrees of fusion and separability between data groups in representation space is a fundamental problem in representation learning, particularly under domain shift. A meaningful metric should capture fusion-altering factors like geometric displacement between representation groups, whose variations change the extent of fusion, while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors such as global scaling and sampling-induced layout changes, whose variations do not. Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity. We characterize the invariance and sensitivity properties of CFD theoretically and validate them in controlled synthetic experiments. For practical utility on real-world datasets with domain shift, CFD aligns more closely with downstream generalization degradation than commonly used alternatives. Overall, CFD provides a theoretically grounded and interpretable distance measure for representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) "knowledge directions". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

Abstract: The placement of normalization layers, specifically Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, remains an open question in Transformer architecture design. In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.

Abstract: Optimizing Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) using policy gradient (a.k.a CVaR-PG) faces significant challenges of sample inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.

Abstract: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究揭示了LLM辅助评审对LLM辅助论文的交互效应，发现LLM辅助评审普遍对低质量论文更宽容，完全LLM生成的评审质量较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在同行评审过程中的使用及其对评审结果的影响，特别是LLM辅助评审是否对LLM辅助论文存在偏好。

Method: 分析了超过125,000篇论文-评审对，重点关注LLM辅助评审与LLM辅助论文之间的交互效应。

Result: LLM辅助评审对低质量论文更为宽容，而完全由LLM生成的评审存在评分压缩问题，无法区分论文质量。

Conclusion: :

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

Motivation: 解决现有基于DEL的认知规划中因目标不同DEL片段和临时语言导致的碎片化问题，缺乏统一的基准表示语言。

Method: 提出并形式化定义了EPDDL（认知规划领域定义语言），包括抽象事件模型的新表示方法、语法和语义的形式化规范。

Conclusion: EPDDL通过统一的PDDL-like表示法解决了现有认知规划中的碎片化问题，促进了互操作性、可重复评估和未来认知规划的发展。

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

TL;DR: Bayesian-LoRA通过概率低秩表示改进LoRA，显著提升模型校准性能，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在准确性上过于强调，导致预测时即使不确定也会猜测，尤其是在小数据集上微调时，容易出现校准不足的问题。

Method: 将确定性LoRA更新重新表述为受稀疏高斯过程启发的概率低秩表示，并利用Kronecker分解的SGP后验与LoRA的结构同构性。

Result: Bayesian-LoRA在仅增加约0.42M参数和1.2倍训练成本的情况下，显著提升了模型的校准性能，ECE和NLL分别降低了84%和76%，同时保持了较高的准确性。

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA通过引入概率低秩表示，显著提高了大型语言模型的校准性能，同时保持了较高的准确性，适用于分布内和分布外评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUARK是一个无需训练的框架，通过建模查询不确定性（通过恢复假设）和引入查询锚定聚合，显著提升了非忠实查询下的检索鲁棒性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的用户查询往往是非忠实的（嘈杂、不完整或扭曲），导致检索器在关键语义缺失时失效。

Method: QUARK通过恢复假设（即对观察到的查询的潜在意图的多种合理解释）显式建模查询不确定性，并引入查询锚定聚合来稳健地结合这些信号。

Result: 在控制模拟和BEIR基准测试中，QUARK显著提高了召回率、MRR和nDCG，且对恢复假设的数量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过恢复假设建模查询不确定性，并结合原则性的锚定聚合，对于非忠实查询下的鲁棒检索至关重要。

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

Abstract: We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

Motivation: 临床出院计划要求高可靠性，LLM虽被认为有潜力但目前因幻觉遗漏和置信度不准应用受限，因此引入确定性配对框架以系统测量改进可靠性。

Method: 基于MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR实现了实验管道，将LLM Planner与确定性Auditor配对，评估多任务覆盖率，校准置信度以及计划偏差监控，支持双层自我改进循环（内部直接重新生成；交叉不一致缓冲）。

Result: 覆盖任务率32%提高到86%，置信度校准指标改进减少错误并遗漏。不一致缓冲进一步纠正案例中持续发生的高置信度遗漏

Conclusion: Planner-Auditor框架基于FHIR数据确定性审计，为自动化出院计划提供了更安全的迭代方式，核心在于改进LLM的可靠性无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound--based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies. White-Op is open-sourced at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/zhchenfdu/whiteop}.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhongkaiyu/ChipBench.git.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

Abstract: Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

Abstract: Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

Abstract: Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

Abstract: Depth-recurrence facilitates latent reasoning by sharing parameters across depths. However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

Abstract: Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master.

Abstract: Enterprise-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems support high-stakes workflows across finance, insurance, and healthcare. Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.

Abstract: Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

Abstract: Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.
  We present ScholarGym, a simulation environment for reproducible evaluation of deep research workflows on academic literature. The environment decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, enabling fine-grained analysis of each stage under controlled conditions. Built on a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval, ScholarGym provides 2,536 queries with expert-annotated ground truth. Experiments across diverse backbone models reveal how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/sonic-o1/ Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vector-institute/sonic-o1 Github: https://github.com/vectorinstitute/sonic-o1 Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vector-institute/sonic-o1-leaderboard

Abstract: Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many tasks, yet inference is still dominated by strictly token-by-token autoregression. Existing acceleration methods largely patch this pipeline and miss core human-reading ingredients: content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and train--test consistency for preview/skimming. We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

Abstract: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy data ubiquitous in real-world applications. Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications. Our code is available at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/DropoutTS.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

Abstract: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

Abstract: We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary. This work explores extending the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts. The approach establishes a foundation for broader applications involving sequential decision-making and supports integration with knowledge evolution mechanisms for learning and refining abstract concepts over time.

Abstract: This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

Abstract: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

Abstract: Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

Abstract: The rise of model hubs has made it easier to access reusable model components, making model merging a practical tool for combining capabilities. Yet, this modularity also creates a \emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.

Abstract: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision. The code and model are available at https://github.com/lilinwz/ProRAG.

Abstract: The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

Abstract: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

Abstract: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

Abstract: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

Abstract: Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Abstract: Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

Abstract: Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

Abstract: In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.
