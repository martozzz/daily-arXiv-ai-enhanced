<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决三轴磁力计组件随传感器姿态变化而改变的问题，即使地磁场总强度目标不变。

Method: 使用Gram矩阵构建规范框架，并在原始坐标中应用状态依赖的频谱缩放，以避免符号不连续性。

Result: 在五次飞行实验中，NavFormer表现出比基线方法更低的预测误差。

Conclusion: NavFormer通过旋转不变标量特征和Canonical SPD模块，显著提升了地磁场总强度的预测精度，实验验证了其在标准训练、少样本训练和零样本迁移中的优越性。

Abstract: Triad magnetometer components change with sensor attitude even when the IGRF total intensity target stays invariant. NavFormer forecasts this invariant target with rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window level second moments of the triads without sign discontinuities. The module builds a canonical frame from a Gram matrix per window and applies state dependent spectral scaling in the original coordinates. Experiments across five flights show lower error than strong baselines in standard training, few shot training, and zero shot transfer.

### [2] [Latent Structural Similarity Networks for Unsupervised Discovery in Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18803)
*Olusegun Owoeye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to analyze multivariate time series by constructing a relational hypothesis graph using unsupervised learning, demonstrated on cryptocurrency data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To propose a task-agnostic discovery layer for multivariate time series that constructs a relational hypothesis graph without relying on linearity, stationarity, or downstream objectives.

Method: The method involves learning window-level sequence representations via an unsupervised sequence-to-sequence autoencoder, aggregating these into entity-level embeddings, and inducing a sparse similarity network by thresholding a latent-space similarity measure.

Result: A sparse similarity network is formed, compressed for pairwise search space, and exposes candidate relationships for investigation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully constructs a relational hypothesis graph over entities in multivariate time series data, demonstrating applicability on cryptocurrency returns.

Abstract: This paper proposes a task-agnostic discovery layer for multivariate time series that constructs a relational hypothesis graph over entities without assuming linearity, stationarity, or a downstream objective. The method learns window-level sequence representations using an unsupervised sequence-to-sequence autoencoder, aggregates these representations into entity-level embeddings, and induces a sparse similarity network by thresholding a latent-space similarity measure. This network is intended as an analyzable abstraction that compresses the pairwise search space and exposes candidate relationships for further investigation, rather than as a model optimized for prediction, trading, or any decision rule. The framework is demonstrated on a challenging real-world dataset of hourly cryptocurrency returns, illustrating how latent similarity induces coherent network structure; a classical econometric relation is also reported as an external diagnostic lens to contextualize discovered edges.

### [3] [Variational Quantum Circuit-Based Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18811)
*Vincent Gurgul,Ying Chen,Stefan Lessmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRL for dynamic portfolio optimization shows competitive performance with classical methods, fewer parameters, and robustness, but practical deployment is limited by latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore quantum analogues of classical reinforcement learning algorithms for dynamic portfolio optimization, aiming to achieve comparable or superior risk-adjusted performance with improved parameter efficiency and robustness under changing market conditions.

Method: The paper implements Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) using Variational Quantum Circuits, specifically quantum analogues of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Empirical evaluation is conducted on real-world financial data.

Result: The results show that quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to or exceeding classical models with fewer parameters, exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, but face practical limitations due to cloud-based quantum system latency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) is theoretically competitive with classical reinforcement learning and shows promise for practical applications in dynamic decision-making, particularly in financial markets, as deployment overheads decrease.

Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

### [4] [VAE with Hyperspherical Coordinates: Improving Anomaly Detection from Hypervolume-Compressed Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18823)
*Alejandro Ascarate,Leo Lebrat,Rodrigo Santa Cruz,Clinton Fookes,Olivier Salvado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VAEs with hyperspherical latent coordinates improve anomaly detection by addressing high-dimensional challenges, outperforming existing methods on real-world and benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VAEs face challenges in high-dimensional latent spaces, such as hypervolume growth and difficulty in detecting anomalies, due to latent vectors distributing on hypersphere equators.

Method: The paper proposes using hyperspherical coordinates to compress latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, enhancing the expressive capacity of the approximate posterior.

Result: The method achieves superior performance in both fully unsupervised and out-of-distribution (OOD) anomaly detection tasks, as demonstrated on real-world datasets like Mars Rover imagery and standard benchmarks like Cifar10.

Conclusion: The proposed hyperspherical coordinate formulation for VAE latent variables improves anomaly detection performance, outperforming existing methods on complex datasets.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

### [5] [IPBC: An Interactive Projection-Based Framework for Human-in-the-Loop Semi-Supervised Clustering of High-Dimensional Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18828)
*Mohammad Zare*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IPBC is an interactive clustering framework combining user feedback and nonlinear projection to improve high-dimensional data clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional datasets are challenging to cluster due to diminishing distance metric usefulness and cluster overlap in lower dimensions. Traditional static embeddings lack interpretability and user interaction.

Method: IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a user feedback loop, allowing adjustments to embeddings and constraints (must-link/cannot-link) to reshape the projection. A clustering algorithm then operates on the optimized 2D layout, followed by an explainability component mapping clusters back to the original feature space.

Result: Experiments show that a few interactive refinement steps significantly enhance cluster quality.

Conclusion: IPBC transforms clustering into a collaborative process, combining machine representation and human insight to improve cluster quality through iterative refinement.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

### [6] [CP Loss: Channel-wise Perceptual Loss for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18829)
*Yaohua Zha,Chunlin Fan,Peiyuan Liu,Yong Jiang,Tao Dai,Hai Wu,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出通道感知损失（CP Loss），通过为每个通道学习独特的感知空间，解决多通道时间序列数据中通道异质性导致的预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多通道时间序列数据存在显著的通道异质性，但现有预测模型通常使用通道无关的损失函数（如MSE），无法捕捉通道特异性动态（如剧烈波动或趋势变化）。

Method: 设计了一个可学习的通道滤波器，将原始信号分解为多尺度表示，构建感知空间。滤波器与主预测模型联合优化，确保感知空间明确面向预测任务。

Result: 提出的CP Loss能够有效捕捉通道特异性动态，提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通道感知损失（CP Loss），通过为每个通道学习独特的感知空间，解决了多通道时间序列数据中通道异质性导致的预测问题。实验表明，该方法能够有效捕捉通道特异性动态，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.

### [7] [How Much Temporal Modeling is Enough? A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18830)
*Alireza Jafari,Fatemeh Jafari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A CNN with a single BiLSTM layer performs best for multi-label ECG classification, showing deeper recurrent models aren't necessary and may reduce precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the challenges in multi-label ECG classification, such as multiple coexisting cardiac conditions, class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies, and the lack of rigorous examination of the necessity of complex deep architectures.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates CNNs combined with various recurrent configurations (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and their stacked variants) on the PTB-XL dataset to assess their impact on temporal modeling and performance.

Result: The CNN with a single BiLSTM layer achieved superior performance metrics (Hamming loss: 0.0338, macro-AUPRC: 0.4715, micro-F1: 0.6979, subset accuracy: 0.5723) compared to deeper recurrent combinations, indicating diminishing returns with increased recurrent depth.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer offers the best balance between predictive performance and model complexity for multi-label ECG classification, suggesting that deeper recurrent models may not be necessary and could harm generalization.

Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.

### [8] [The Geometric Reasoner: Manifold-Informed Latent Foresight Search for Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18832)
*Ren Zhuang,Ben Wang,Shuifa Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TGR 是一种无需训练的长链推理框架，通过几何优化和内存线性设计显著提升覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在高计算成本和覆盖率质量之间的权衡问题，提供一种无需训练且高效的解决方案。

Method: TGR 通过轻量级的超前估计和软几何正则化器对候选潜在锚点进行评分，并在每个块边界重置 KV 缓存以保持内存线性。

Result: 在数学和代码基准测试中，TGR 将 Pass@k 曲线下的面积 (AUC) 提高了最多 13 个百分点（Qwen3-8B 模型），计算开销仅为 1.1--1.3 倍。

Conclusion: TGR 是一种无需训练、高效的内存线性框架，能够在低计算开销下显著提升长链推理的覆盖率。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

Conclusion: HaKAN consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in multivariate time series forecasting, offering a lightweight and interpretable alternative to Transformers and MLPs.

Abstract: Recent Transformer- and MLP-based models have demonstrated strong performance in long-term time series forecasting, yet Transformers remain limited by their quadratic complexity and permutation-equivariant attention, while MLPs exhibit spectral bias. We propose HaKAN, a versatile model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), leveraging Hahn polynomial-based learnable activation functions and providing a lightweight and interpretable alternative for multivariate time series forecasting. Our model integrates channel independence, patching, a stack of Hahn-KAN blocks with residual connections, and a bottleneck structure comprised of two fully connected layers. The Hahn-KAN block consists of inter- and intra-patch KAN layers to effectively capture both global and local temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on various forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its core components.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization, showing its potential despite practical inefficiency compared to dynamic programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential advantages of Bellman residual minimization, such as stable convergence with function approximation, despite its lower efficiency in practice.

Method: The study focuses on Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization, contrasting it with dynamic programming.

Result: Foundational results for Bellman residual minimization in policy optimization are established, demonstrating its viability for control tasks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes foundational results for Bellman residual minimization in policy optimization, highlighting its potential advantages over dynamic programming despite practical challenges.

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

### [11] [Representational Homomorphism Predicts and Improves Compositional Generalization In Transformer Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18858)
*Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Homomorphism Error (HE) to diagnose and improve compositional generalization in neural networks, showing its effectiveness in controlled experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of compositional generalization in neural networks by understanding representational-level failures.

Method: The study introduces Homomorphism Error (HE) as a structural metric, instantiated for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks, and tests its predictive power and actionable potential through controlled experiments.

Result: HE predicts OOD compositional generalization with high correlation (R^2 = 0.73), and HE-regularized training significantly improves OOD accuracy.

Conclusion: HE is a promising diagnostic and training signal for improving compositional generalization in neural networks.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-the ability to interpret novel combinations of familiar components-remains a persistent challenge for neural networks. Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.

### [12] [ASEHybrid: When Geometry Matters Beyond Homophily in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18912)
*Shalima Binta Manir,Tim Oates*

TL;DR: 论文提出几何感知GNN框架ASEHybrid，理论证明其在标签信息丰富的异质图上优于基线，实证验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准GNN在低同质性图上表现不佳的问题，并探索标签信息性（LI）对图结构有用性的影响。

Method: 通过曲率引导的重连和位置几何学，开发了ASEHybrid架构，并结合理论分析验证其有效性。

Result: 理论分析表明，几何感知GNN的改进仅在图结构提供超出节点特征的标签相关信息时可能实现。实证结果显示，ASEHybrid在标签信息丰富的异质图上表现优异。

Conclusion: 几何感知的GNN（如ASEHybrid）在标签信息丰富的异质图上能显著提升性能，而在高基线区域则无明显改进。

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

*Semih Cantürk,Andrei Manolache,Arman Mielke,Chendi Qian,Antoine Siraudin,Christopher Morris,Mathias Niepert,Guy Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraIP framework unifies graph learning tasks as inverse problems, offering a theoretical foundation and practical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a unifying theoretical foundation for diverse graph learning tasks, which are often developed in isolation.

Method: The GraIP framework formalizes graph learning tasks as inverse problems, aiming to recover underlying graph structures from observational data by reversing forward processes like message passing.

Result: GraIP is shown to be versatile across tasks like rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference, with proposed benchmarks and empirical evaluations of baseline methods.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) framework as a unifying theoretical foundation for various graph learning tasks, demonstrating its versatility and proposing benchmarks for evaluation.

Abstract: A wide range of graph learning tasks, such as structure discovery, temporal graph analysis, and combinatorial optimization, focus on inferring graph structures from data, rather than making predictions on given graphs. However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.

Conclusion: 该解决方案在VN2库存规划挑战赛中获胜，通过结合强大的全局预测模型和轻量级的成本感知策略，为现实世界的库存规划问题提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

### [15] [Toward Learning POMDPs Beyond Full-Rank Actions and State Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18930)
*Seiji Shaw,Travis Manderson,Chad Kessens,Nicholas Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method combining spectral and tensor techniques learns POMDP parameters for hidden state systems, matching PSR performance and providing explicit likelihoods for planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states (e.g., furniture with hidden locking mechanisms) by constructing POMDP parameters from action-observation sequences without prior knowledge of the state space, transitions, or observation models.

Method: The approach combines spectral methods (PSRs) with tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, relaxing assumptions of full state observability and full-rank transition matrices.

Result: The method learns observation and transition matrices up to a partition of states, achieving performance comparable to PSRs for POMDP solvers and enabling explicit likelihood estimates for planning.

Conclusion: The method successfully learns partition-level transition models that match the performance of Predictive State Representations (PSRs) for POMDP solvers, while also providing explicit observation and transition likelihoods for downstream planning tasks.

Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.

TL;DR: A bi-level OCO-CMDP algorithm addresses dynamic network resource allocation with near-optimal regret and constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the limitations of existing OCO and CMDP approaches, which fail to capture dynamic network resource allocation challenges, such as queue evolution and varying constraint thresholds.

Method: The method involves a bi-level learning approach combining upper-level online convex optimization (OCO) and lower-level constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), with a dual feedback mechanism and budget-adaptive safe exploration.

Result: The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves near-optimal regret and ensures high-probability satisfaction of cross-level constraints.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the bi-level OCO-CMDP learning problem, achieving near-optimal regret and high-probability satisfaction of cross-level constraints.

Abstract: We study a bi-level online provisioning and scheduling problem motivated by network resource allocation, where provisioning decisions are made at a slow time scale while queue-/state-dependent scheduling is performed at a fast time scale. We model this two-time-scale interaction using an upper-level online convex optimization (OCO) problem and a lower-level constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Existing OCO typically assumes stateless decisions and thus cannot capture MDP network dynamics such as queue evolution. Meanwhile, CMDP algorithms typically assume a fixed constraint threshold, whereas in provisioning-and-scheduling systems, the threshold varies with online budget decisions. To address these gaps, we study bi-level OCO-CMDP learning under switching costs (budget reprovisioning/system reconfiguration) and cross-level constraints that couple budgets to scheduling decisions. Our new algorithm solves this learning problem via several non-trivial developments, including a carefully designed dual feedback that returns the budget multiplier as sensitivity information for the upper-level update and a lower level that solves a budget-adaptive safe exploration problem via an extended occupancy-measure linear program. We establish near-optimal regret and high-probability satisfaction of the cross-level constraints.

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled measurement devices in modern power systems has expanded the cyberattack surface of the grid. As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

Abstract: A key challenge in employing data, algorithms and data-driven systems is to adhere to the principle of fairness and justice. Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is central to drug discovery, yet graph neural networks often underperform in data-scarce regimes and fail to surpass traditional fingerprints. We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures. The code is available at the link https://github.com/microsoft/TimeCraft.

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

Abstract: We rigorously study the thermodynamic limit of deep neural networks (DNNS) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), assuming that the activation functions are sigmoids. A thermodynamic limit is a continuous neural network, where the neurons form a continuous space with infinitely many points. We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs. In this case, the network parameters are generalized Gaussian random variables in a space of quadratic integrable functions. We compute the probability distribution of the output given the input, in the infinite-width case. We show that it admits a power-type expansion, where the constant term is a Gaussian distribution.

Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.

Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

Abstract: Machine learning systems engineering requires a deep understanding of framework internals. Yet most current education separates algorithms from systems. Students learn gradient descent without measuring memory usage, and attention mechanisms without profiling computational cost. This split leaves graduates unprepared to debug real production failures and widens the gap between machine learning research and reliable deployment. We present TinyTorch, a 20 module curriculum in which students implement the core components of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, optimizers, and neural networks, entirely in pure Python. The curriculum is built around three pedagogical principles. Progressive disclosure gradually introduces complexity as students build confidence. Systems first integration embeds memory and performance awareness from the very beginning. Historical milestone validation guides students to recreate key breakthroughs, from the Perceptron in 1958 to modern Transformers, using only code they have written themselves. TinyTorch requires only a laptop with 4GB of RAM and no GPU, making machine learning systems education accessible worldwide. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of AI engineers, practitioners who understand not only what machine learning systems do, but why they work and how to make them scale. The curriculum is available as open source at mlsysbook.ai slash tinytorch.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been applied to inverse scattering problems (ISPs) due to their strong nonlinear mapping capabilities. However, supervised DNN solvers require large-scale datasets, which limits their generalization in practical applications. Untrained neural networks (UNNs) address this issue by updating weights from measured electric fields and prior physical knowledge, but existing UNN solvers suffer from long inference time. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a contrast-source-based physics-driven neural network (CSPDNN), which predicts the induced current distribution to improve efficiency and incorporates an adaptive total variation loss for robust reconstruction under varying contrast and noise conditions. The improved imaging performance is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental data.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality, yet face a fundamental challenge known as memorization, where generated samples can replicate training samples exactly. We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.

Abstract: Accurately predicting procurement lead time (PLT) remains a challenge in engineered-to-order industries such as shipbuilding and plant construction, where delays in a single key component can disrupt project timelines. In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks. These findings indicate the value of considering procurement process information for more accurate PLT prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce contextual queueing bandits, a new context-aware framework for scheduling while simultaneously learning unknown service rates. Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks. Our code is released at https://github.com/MarquisDarwin/EAWM.

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

Abstract: Injury occurrence in football poses significant challenges for athletes and teams, carrying personal, competitive, and financial consequences. While machine learning has been applied to injury prediction before, existing approaches often rely on static pre-season data and binary outcomes, limiting their real-world utility. This study investigates the feasibility of using a DeepHit neural network to forecast time-to-injury from longitudinal athlete monitoring data, while providing interpretable predictions. The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation. DeepHit achieved a concordance index of 0.762, outperforming baseline models and delivering individualised, time-varying risk estimates. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified clinically relevant predictors consistent with established risk factors, enhancing interpretability. Overall, this study provides a novel proof of concept: survival modelling with DeepHit shows strong potential to advance injury forecasting in football, offering accurate, explainable, and actionable insights for injury prevention across competitive levels.

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning often faces environment drift, but most existing methods rely on static entropy coefficients/target entropy, causing over-exploration during stable periods and under-exploration after drift (thus slow recovery), and leaving unanswered the principled question of how exploration intensity should scale with drift magnitude. We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead. Across 4 algorithm variants, 12 tasks, and 4 drift modes, AES significantly reduces the fraction of performance degradation caused by drift and accelerates recovery after abrupt changes.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP. Code is available at this repo: github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/GenCP.

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial tool in time series forecasting, especially for deep learning architectures that require a large training sample size to generalize effectively. However, extensive datasets are not always available in real-world scenarios. Although many data augmentation methods exist, their limitations include the use of transformations that do not adequately preserve data properties. This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based approach for synthetic time series generation that: (1) converts univariate time series into a network structure using a graph representation, where each state is a node and each transition is represented as a directed edge; and (2) encodes their temporal dynamics in a transition probability matrix. We performed an extensive evaluation of Grasynda as a data augmentation method for time series forecasting. We use three neural network variations on six benchmark datasets. The results indicate that Grasynda consistently outperforms other time series data augmentation methods, including ones used in state-of-the-art time series foundation models. The method and all experiments are publicly available.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

Abstract: Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to deep networks' ability to exploit hierarchical structure in data, constructing increasingly complex features across layers. Yet despite substantial progress in deep learning theory, most optimization results sill focus on networks with only two or three layers, leaving the theoretical understanding of hierarchical learning in genuinely deep models limited. This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure?
  In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class. Our proof builds on a general observation: if intermediate layers can receive clean signal from the labels and the relevant features are weakly identifiable, then layerwise training each individual layer suffices to hierarchically learn the target function.

Abstract: Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.
  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

Abstract: We study grokking, the onset of generalization long after overfitting, in a classical ridge regression setting. We prove end-to-end grokking results for learning over-parameterized linear regression models using gradient descent with weight decay. Specifically, we prove that the following stages occur: (i) the model overfits the training data early during training; (ii) poor generalization persists long after overfitting has manifested; and (iii) the generalization error eventually becomes arbitrarily small. Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the "grokking time") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks. Our results suggest that grokking is not an inherent failure mode of deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions, and thus does not require fundamental changes to the model architecture or learning algorithm to avoid.

Abstract: The transition from monolithic to multi-component neural architectures in advanced neural network controllers poses substantial challenges due to the high computational complexity of the latter. Conventional model compression techniques for complexity reduction, such as structured pruning based on norm-based metrics to estimate the relative importance of distinct parameter groups, often fail to capture functional significance. This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks. Our work suggests that predicting downstream scaling laws directly from data outperforms parametric alternatives.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both regret and constraint violation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Abstract: Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic BPM Systems (A-BPMS), integrating AI and process mining to shift from automation to autonomy, redefining process governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Generative and Agentic AI presents an opportunity to shift focus from automation to autonomy in BPM, moving from design-driven to data-driven management.

Method: The paper outlines an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS), leveraging process mining techniques to enable agents to sense, reason, and act for process optimization.

Result: The proposed A-BPMS integrates autonomy, reasoning, and learning, enabling a new class of platforms for process management and execution.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the integration of autonomy, reasoning, and learning into Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS) will redefine process automation and governance, supporting a continuum from human-driven to fully autonomous processes.

Abstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited structural diversity in existing test suites like BBOB for benchmarking continuous black-box optimization.

Method: The LLaMEA framework was used to guide an LLM in generating problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties. ELA-based property predictors scored candidates, and an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism enhanced population diversity.

Result: The generated functions exhibited intended structural traits, verified through basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing, and visual inspection. A t-SNE embedding confirmed the expansion of the BBOB instance space.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can generate diverse and interpretable benchmark problems for continuous black-box optimization, expanding the BBOB instance space. The resulting library is valuable for landscape analysis and automated algorithm selection.

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

Conclusion: :

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在复杂工作流中保持指令流的能力，以及现有基准在分离任务复杂性和结构顺序方面的不足。

Method: 通过引入RIFT（重新排序指令遵循测试平台），使用线性提示和跳跃提示两种结构，评估了六种最先进的开源LLM在10,000次测试中的表现。

Result: 在跳跃提示条件下，模型的准确率下降了高达72%，且约50%的失败源于指令顺序违反和语义漂移。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在非顺序指令执行中存在显著的结构敏感性，限制了其在需要非顺序控制流的应用中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在验证条件（VC）证明中显示出潜力，但在程序验证方面仍存在重大挑战，凸显了未来研究的巨大差距和机会。

Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.

Abstract: As LLMs increasingly act as autonomous agents in interactive and multi-agent settings, understanding their strategic behavior is critical for safety, coordination, and AI-driven social and economic systems. We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D methods for emotional talking face synthesis face challenges in audio-vision emotion alignment and lack of control over emotional micro-expressions. Additionally, current multi-view fusion strategies are inadequate.

Method: UA-3DTalk includes three core modules: Prior Extraction, Emotion Distillation, and Uncertainty-based Deformation. These modules address challenges in audio-vision emotion alignment and multi-view fusion strategy.

Result: UA-3DTalk achieves improvements in emotion alignment, lip synchronization, and rendering quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Motivation: Existing methods for improving function call capabilities in LLMs lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: A novel adversarial data augmentation method using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate challenging queries, with a zero-sum game formulation between the query model and the function call model.

Result: The method advances the development of more robust function call models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in LLMs' interaction with external tools.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial data augmentation method significantly enhances the robustness and generalization of function call capabilities in LLMs by systematically identifying and addressing their weaknesses through iterative training.

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

TL;DR: LAIN通过长度自适应机制平衡长短序列建模，显著提升短序列用户准确性，同时保持长序列效果，解决了顺序推荐中的长度偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统中的用户行为序列长度存在显著异质性，现有CTR模型在增加最大输入序列长度时，由于注意力极化和训练数据长度不平衡，反而会降低短序列用户的性能。

Method: LAIN框架包含三个轻量级组件：Spectral Length Encoder（将长度映射为连续表示）、Length-Conditioned Prompting（向长短期行为分支注入全局上下文线索）和Length-Modulated Attention（根据序列长度自适应调整注意力锐度）。

Result: 在三个真实基准数据集和五个强CTR骨干模型上的实验表明，LAIN显著提升了整体性能（AUC增益达1.15%，对数损失降低2.25%），尤其在不牺牲长序列用户效果的情况下显著提高了短序列用户的准确性。

Conclusion: LAIN（Length-Adaptive Interest Network）通过显式地将序列长度作为条件信号，有效平衡了长序列和短序列用户的建模，显著提升了短序列用户的准确性，同时保持了长序列用户的效果。该方法为顺序推荐中的长度偏差问题提供了一个通用、高效且可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation.

Conclusion: LocationAgent通过分层推理逻辑和外部工具验证地理证据，显著提升了图像地理定位的准确性和泛化能力，尤其在零样本设置中表现优异。

Abstract: Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\% in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.

TL;DR: CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism, reduces KV cache size to 0.8% by leveraging shared information, maintaining performance in sequential recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that KV sequences across users exhibit significant similarities, suggesting the existence of collaborative signals in KV. The analysis via SVD reveals that most KV information is shareable, while a small portion is user-specific.

Method: The paper introduces CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism that captures shared information through a learnable global KV pool and combines it with user-specific KV during inference.

Result: Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that CollectiveKV compresses the KV cache to 0.8% of its original size without compromising performance.

Conclusion: CollectiveKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 0.8% of its original size while maintaining or enhancing model performance, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in sequential recommendation systems.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.

Abstract: Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories. Task trajectories are publicly available at https://lisalsj.github.io/Droidrun-appcard/.

Abstract: As large language models become integral to agentic artificial intelligence systems, their energy demands during inference may pose significant sustainability challenges. This study investigates whether deploying smaller-scale language models can reduce energy consumption without compromising responsiveness and output quality in a multi-agent, real-world environments. We conduct a comparative analysis across language models of varying scales to quantify trade-offs between efficiency and performance. Results show that smaller open-weights models can lower energy usage while preserving task quality. Building on these findings, we propose practical guidelines for sustainable artificial intelligence design, including optimal batch size configuration and computation resource allocation. These insights offer actionable strategies for developing scalable, environmentally responsible artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly comprise multiple interconnected neural networks to tackle complex inference tasks. Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges. Current state-of-the-art robustness testing techniques, whether black-box or white-box, have been proposed and implemented for single-network models and do not scale well to multi-network pipelines. We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains. We apply the framework to a real-world autonomous rail inspection system composed of multiple deep networks and successfully demonstrate how our approach enables fine-grained robustness analysis beyond conventional end-to-end metrics.

Abstract: Production LLM deployments serve diverse workloads where cost and quality requirements vary by customer tier, time of day, and query criticality. Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model.

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/yhz5613813/RPO.

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

Abstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.

Abstract: Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities. To address this, we present ComAgent, a multi-LLM agentic AI framework. ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.

Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

Our study shows that routing becomes increasingly challenging with larger, domain-overlapping DB repositories and ambiguous queries, motivating the need for more structured and robust reasoning-based solutions. By explicitly modelling schema coverage, structural connectivity, and fine-grained semantic alignment, the proposed modular, reasoning-driven reranking strategy consistently outperforms embedding-only and direct LLM-prompting baselines across all the metrics.

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.
