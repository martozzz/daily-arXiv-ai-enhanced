However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \\emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \\emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5199\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u62b5\u5fa1\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5229\u7528\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u539f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u84b8\u998f\u548cAPI\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5199\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cd\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6API\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aAPI\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{SAH^3}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs.

The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al.

The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting.

Despite numerous successful applications, particularly within the flow matching paradigm, all existing NODE models are fundamentally constrained to fixed-dimensional dynamics by the intrinsic nature of the manifold's dimension. In this paper, we extend NODEs to M-polyfolds (spaces that can simultaneously accommodate varying dimensions and a notion of differentiability) and introduce PolyNODEs, the first variable-dimensional flow-based model in geometric deep learning. As an example application, we construct explicit M-polyfolds featuring dimensional bottlenecks and PolyNODE autoencoders based on parametrised vector fields that traverse these bottlenecks. We demonstrate experimentally that our PolyNODE models can be trained to solve reconstruction tasks in these spaces, and that latent representations of the input can be extracted and used to solve downstream classification tasks.

Prior self-supervised meth- ods either impute before learning, represent missingness through a dedicated input signal, or optimize solely for imputation, reducing their capacity to efficiently learn representations that support clinical downstream tasks. We propose the Augmented-Intrinsic Dual-Masked Autoencoder (AID-MAE), which learns directly from incomplete time series by applying an intrinsic missing mask to represent naturally missing values and an augmented mask that hides a subset of observed values for reconstruction during training. AID-MAE processes only the unmasked subset of tokens and consistently outperforms strong baselines, including XGBoost and DuETT, across multiple clinical tasks on two datasets. In addition, the learned embeddings naturally stratify patient cohorts in the representation space.", "AI": {"tldr": "AID-MAE learns from incomplete EHR time series using dual masks, improving clinical task performance and cohort stratification.", "motivation": "Addresses challenges in EHR time series learning, such as irregular sampling and missing data, without relying on prior imputation methods.", "method": "Utilizes an Augmented-Intrinsic Dual-Masked Autoencoder (AID-MAE) that applies masks to represent missing values and reconstruct observed values during training.", "result": "AID-MAE outperforms strong baselines (e.g., XGBoost, DuETT) across multiple clinical tasks and successfully stratifies patient cohorts.", "conclusion": "AID-MAE effectively learns from incomplete EHR time series by leveraging dual masks (intrinsic and augmented), outperforming baselines in clinical tasks and stratifying patient cohorts."}}

To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions.

Dean"], "title": "When Remembering and Planning are Worth it: Navigating under Change", "comment": null, "summary": "We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u6e90\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b8c\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c4f\u969c\u548c\u98df\u7269\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bcf\u65e5\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u56fe\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fd0\u7528\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u672a\u77e5\u98df\u7269\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c4\u5212\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

While existing approaches focus primarily on learning simulations from the target PDE, they often overlook more fundamental physical principles underlying these equations. Inspired by how numerical solvers are compatible with simulations of different settings of PDEs, we propose a multiphysics training framework that jointly learns from both the original PDEs and their simplified basic forms. Our framework enhances data efficiency, reduces predictive errors, and improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, particularly in scenarios involving shifts of physical parameters and synthetic-to-real transfer. Our method is architecture-agnostic and demonstrates consistent improvements in normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) across a wide range of 1D/2D/3D PDE problems.

However, enforcing a single shared subspace can degrade accuracy even at moderate compression. Sparse dictionary learning provides a more flexible union-of-subspaces representation, but existing approaches often suffer from iterative dictionary and coefficient updates. We propose COMPOT (Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), a training-free compression framework that uses a small calibration dataset to estimate a sparse weight factorization. COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under a global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces a one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks show that COMPOT consistently delivers a superior quality-compression trade-off over strong low-rank and sparse baselines, while remaining fully compatible with post-training quantization for extreme compression.

Currently, it remains unclear how to jointly learn reward functions from heterogeneous feedback types such as demonstrations, comparisons, ratings, and stops that provide qualitatively different signals. We address this challenge by formulating reward learning from multiple feedback types as Bayesian inference over a shared latent reward function, where each feedback type contributes information through an explicit likelihood. We introduce a scalable amortized variational inference approach that learns a shared reward encoder and feedback-specific likelihood decoders and is trained by optimizing a single evidence lower bound. Our approach avoids reducing feedback to a common intermediate representation and eliminates the need for manual loss balancing. Across discrete and continuous-control benchmarks, we show that jointly inferred reward posteriors outperform single-type baselines, exploit complementary information across feedback types, and yield policies that are more robust to environment perturbations.

A further challenge is the performance interference that can arise from joint multilingual training, commonly referred to as the \"curse of multilinguality\". We study multilingual data curation across thirteen languages and find that many reported regressions are not inherent to multilingual scaling but instead stem from correctable deficiencies in data quality and composition rather than fundamental capacity limits. In controlled bilingual experiments, improving data quality for any single language benefits others: curating English improves non-English performance in 12 of 13 languages, while curating non-English yields reciprocal improvements in English. Bespoke per-language curation produces substantially larger within-language improvements. Extending these findings to large-scale general-purpose training mixtures, we show that curated multilingual allocations comprising under 8% of total tokens remain remarkably effective. We operationalize this approach within an effort that produced a 20T-token pretraining corpus derived entirely from public sources. Models with 3B and 8B parameters trained on a 1T-token random subset achieve competitive multilingual accuracy with 4-10x fewer training FLOPs than strong public baselines, establishing a new Pareto frontier in multilingual performance versus compute. Moreover, these benefits extend to frontier model scale: the 20T-token corpus served as part of the pretraining dataset for Trinity Large (400B/A13B), which exhibits strong multilingual performance relative to its training FLOPs. These results show that targeted, per-language data curation mitigates multilingual interference and enables compute-efficient multilingual scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e8613\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8bed\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6574\u7406\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u751f\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u7406\u540e\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ec5\u5360\u603b\u6807\u8bb0\u76848%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

We offer a simple approach of using an LLM to iteratively propose and refine candidate biases. Our method can recover known biases and surface novel ones: for example, we found that Skywork-V2-8B, a leading open-weight reward model, often mistakenly favors responses with redundant spacing and responses with hallucinated content.

Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems.

Recent CLIP-style models such as DrugCLIP enable scalable virtual screening by embedding pockets and ligands into a shared space. However, our analyses indicate that such representations can be insensitive to fine-grained binding interactions and may rely on shortcut correlations in training data, limiting their ability to rank ligands by true binding compatibility. To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark. Together, these results indicate that integrating generative, pose-level supervision with contrastive learning yields more interaction-aware embeddings and improves generalization in realistic screening settings, bringing virtual screening closer to real-world applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "BindCLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e92\u52a8\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684CLIP\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DrugCLIP\uff09\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e92\u52a8\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u6377\u5173\u8054\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u5408\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6392\u540d\u914d\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "BindCLIP\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4-\u751f\u6210\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCLIP\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u914d\u4f53-\u914d\u4f53\u951a\u5b9a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u8868\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBindCLIP\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u548cFEP+\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u914d\u4f53\u6392\u540d\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BindCLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f7f\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation.

However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks.

However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.\n  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.\n  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Across seven model sizes spanning three orders of magnitude in parameter count (533 to 3.4 x 10^8 parameters), we fit the parametric scaling law to validation mean squared error (MSE). The data-rich regime exhibits clear power-law scaling with an irreducible loss floor of c ~ 1.44, while the data-limited regime shows negligible scaling, indicating that model capacity is not the binding constraint when data are scarce. These results establish that scaling laws analogous to those observed in natural language processing do emerge in single-cell transcriptomics when sufficient data are available, and they identify the data-to-parameter ratio as a critical determinant of scaling behaviour.

Through a controlled hybrid experimental design - training a single shared backbone and comparing lightweight interchangeable heads - we isolate the effect of complex-valued unitary representations on calibration. Our ablation study on CIFAR-10 reveals that the unitary magnitude head (complex features evolved under a Cayley unitary, read out via magnitude and softmax) achieves an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0146, representing a 2.4x improvement over a standard softmax head (0.0355) and a 3.5x improvement over temperature scaling (0.0510).

To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior.

Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints.

To address this issue, we propose Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label Learning (CD-GTMLL), a scalable cooperative framework that recasts long-tail MLC as a multi-player game - each sub-predictor (\"player\") specializes in a partition of the label space, collaborating to maximize global accuracy while pursuing intrinsic curiosity rewards based on tail label rarity and inter-player disagreement.

Extensive experiments across 7 benchmarks, including extreme multi-label classification datasets with 30,000+ labels, demonstrate that CD-GTMLL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with gains up to +1.6% P@3 on Wiki10-31K.

We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score.

Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans.

We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem.

Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In scientific and medical areas, in particular, these models need to be mechanistically tractable -- through their mathematical analysis we would like to obtain insight into the recovered system's workings. Piecewise-linear (PL), ReLU-based RNNs (PLRNNs) have a strong track-record in this regard, representing SOTA DSR models while allowing mathematical insight by virtue of their PL design. However, all current PLRNN variants are discrete-time maps. This is in disaccord with the assumed continuous-time nature of most physical and biological processes, and makes it hard to accommodate data arriving at irregular temporal intervals. Neural ODEs are one solution, but they do not reach the DSR performance of PLRNNs and often lack their tractability. Here we develop theory for continuous-time PLRNNs (cPLRNNs): We present a novel algorithm for training and simulating such models, bypassing numerical integration by efficiently exploiting their PL structure. We further demonstrate how important topological objects like equilibria or limit cycles can be determined semi-analytically in trained models. We compare cPLRNNs to both their discrete-time cousins as well as Neural ODEs on DSR benchmarks, including systems with discontinuities which come with hard thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this gap, we propose CAMEL, the first ELM that is capable of inference over longer signal durations which enables its forecasting capability.

Existing port-Hamiltonian neural network methods have recently been successfully applied for modeling mechanical systems. However, even though these methods are designed on power-balance principles, they usually do not consider power-preserving discretizations and often rely on Runge-Kutta numerical methods. In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order. Experiments are also carried out to compare two theoretically equivalent port-Hamiltonian systems formulations and to analyze the impact of regularizing the Jacobian of port-Hamiltonian neural networks during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, this objective creates an imbalance, where some users receive far too many matches while many others receive very few and eventually abandon the platform. Retaining users is crucial for many platforms, such as those that depend heavily on subscriptions. Some may use fairness objectives to solve the problem of match maximization. However, fairness in itself is not the ultimate objective for many platforms, as users do not suddenly reward the platform simply because exposure is equalized. In practice, where user retention is often the ultimate goal, casually relying on fairness will leave the optimization of retention up to luck.\n  In this work, instead of maximizing matches or axiomatically defining fairness, we formally define the new problem setting of maximizing user retention in two-sided matching platforms. To this end, we introduce a dynamic learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithm called Matching for Retention (MRet). Unlike conventional algorithms for two-sided matching, our approach models user retention by learning personalized retention curves from each user's profile and interaction history. Based on these curves, MRet dynamically adapts recommendations by jointly considering the retention gains of both the user receiving recommendations and those who are being recommended, so that limited matching opportunities can be allocated where they most improve overall retention. Naturally but importantly, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets from a major online dating platform show that MRet achieves higher user retention, since conventional methods optimize matches or fairness rather than retention.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions.

We address this challenge by proposing a TTA framework based on storing maximally informative (D-optimal) statistics, which jointly enables stable adaptation and principled parameter selection at test time. When applied to pretrained simulation surrogates, our method yields up to 7% out-of-distribution improvements at negligible computational cost.

We propose a new metric called task complexity: the length of the shortest program that achieves a target performance on a task. In this framework, the SAH simply claims that pre-trained models drastically reduce the complexity of achieving high performance on many tasks. Our definition unifies prior arguments supporting the SAH, interpreting them as different strategies to find such short programs. Experimentally, we estimate the task complexity of mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following; we then show that these complexities can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Further, we find that pre-training enables access to strong performances on our tasks, but it can require programs of gigabytes of length to access them. Post-training, on the other hand, collapses the complexity of reaching this same performance by several orders of magnitude.
